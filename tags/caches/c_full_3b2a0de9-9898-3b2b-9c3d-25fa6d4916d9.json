That means long dog hair woven in and out of the fibers in my vehicle's carpet after every car ride. Vacuuming just won't seem to pick up the hairs, and if it does, the hose gets clogged. Lint rollers are never quite strong enough to grab pet hair, either. I've found a better solution than banning my dogs from open-window rides in the sun. All a pet owner needs is a simple bathroom item already available in many homes: a pumice stone. Simply rub the pumice stone along the carpet. It will catch the dog (or cat) fur and gather it into a ball you can either throw away or compost. The best part? You won't need to de-hair the pumus stone. Hair releases from it as you clean.","published_at":1528376057,"content_id":"7f7f7bd3-1026-38e4-9e95-2fa4ca5d7331","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/how-to\/remove-pet-hair-from-car\/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CNETAsiaLastest+%28CNET+Asia+Latest%29#ftag=CADf328eec","content_published_at":1528372808,"content_time":1528372808,"content_relative_time":11,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":11,"comment_relative_time":11,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"166c7c18-905b-3d8b-81dc-59a2ff543962","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-d68549d4-fbbc-3c33-94b3-ab35c8930a18_a-166c7c18-905b-3d8b-81dc-59a2ff543962","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-d68549d4-fbbc-3c33-94b3-ab35c8930a18_a-166c7c18-905b-3d8b-81dc-59a2ff543962","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/ohio-cat-shares-house-eight-1oo2omc","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Mail Online","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-5816377\/Ohio-cat-shares-house-eight-lizards-two-birds-four-tortoises.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/P9F2Gi8poF66yquqisBHIA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H22Ro4sViAltgAu3TXYzTg--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_166c7c18-905b-3d8b-81dc-59a2ff543962-403176104.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/2s4zj6S9O7H8zy.R5M4DFA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zODI7dz02MzY7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H22Ro4sViAltgAu3TXYzTg--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_166c7c18-905b-3d8b-81dc-59a2ff543962-403176104.jpeg","height":382,"width":636,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/H22Ro4sViAltgAu3TXYzTg--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_166c7c18-905b-3d8b-81dc-59a2ff543962-403176104.jpeg","imgw":636,"imgh":382,"title":"Ohio cat shares house with eight lizards, two birds and four tortoises","summary":"It isn't unheard of for cats to eat lizards... but this chilled-out feline doesn't see them as a meal.\u00a0 Meet Olive the cat, who likes to spend her days cuddling 12 scaly housemates - eight lizards and four tortoises.

Brubaker evaluated the behavior of search and rescue dogs and pet dogs when presented with the same problem-solving task.

To the horror of guests at a riverside lodge who had gathered to watch the spectacle, the saltwater crocodile did not scurry towards the water as the dog ran at its head.\u00a0 Instead, as the dog\u2019s owner, Kai Hansen, said, the crocodile \"did what crocs do\u201d and clenched the dog in its teeth before returning to the water.\u00a0 Mr Hansen said he was \u201creally sad\u201d and had not watched the graphic footage of the incident, which was captured by onlookers.\u00a0 But\u00a0 he said he did not blame the\u00a0 220-pound crocodile\u00a0 for attacking his\u00a0 15-pound dog. Casey the crocodile on Goat Island \u201cIt was something that had a high probability of happening sometime,\u201d Mr Hansen told ABC News. \"She's not doing something wrong, she's just doing what crocs do. In the early days she actually had a go at me a couple of times. These days I just throw food out from up the top and no-one is allowed to walk down there.\" Mr Hansen runs the Goat Island Lodge, a ramshackle lodge on the crocodile-infested Adelaide River, south of Darwin in the Northern Territory.\u00a0 Guests captured footage of the dog being eaten and could be heard gasping and yelling expletives. A crocodile expert, Adam Britton, said the creature should not be destroyed for eating the dog and may not necessarily attack humans. He said crocodiles which attacked people effectively learnt how to target \u201clarge prey items\u201d. \"The dog got right up close to the crocodile's head,\" Mr Britton told ABC News. \"That basically triggers a reflex reaction, and a crocodile, if you get that close to its head, it doesn't even think about it \u2014 it will just strike. If a crocodile attacks a person it's a little bit different because \u2026 that can potentially lead to it getting [another] large prey item, to put it bluntly.\" Mr Britton said the incident was a reminder to people to stay away from crocodile habitats, particularly if small dogs were present.","published_at":1528356791,"content_id":"c4684566-7d3c-37cc-bee6-c9291fb253bc","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/crocodile-eats-beloved-terrier-spent-121447416.html","content_published_at":1528287287,"content_time":1528287287,"content_relative_time":34,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":34,"comment_relative_time":34,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-47e5f75c-9858-3b15-a47c-2a013724a541_a-cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-47e5f75c-9858-3b15-a47c-2a013724a541_a-cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/queen-meets-hero-medical-dogs-ekkj4bz","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Mail Online","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/femail\/article-5812067\/The-Queen-accompanied-Camilla-attend-dog-charitys-10th-anniversary-celebrations.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7iE5K95M80fUhbJZlBTCrw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gbDf4iQdBkl1Wxd8uGwf2w--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d--556538807.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qe90.gufzm4rVldc9ydkag--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zODI7dz02MzY7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gbDf4iQdBkl1Wxd8uGwf2w--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d--556538807.jpeg","height":382,"width":636,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gbDf4iQdBkl1Wxd8uGwf2w--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d--556538807.jpeg","imgw":636,"imgh":382,"title":"Queen meets hero medical dogs and she looks delighted","summary":"The Queen joined the Duchess of Cornwall to see the remarkable work of the country's cancer-detecting dogs first hand today \u2013 and got more of a demonstration than she bargained for. For as well as being trained to use their extraordinary sense of smell to locate early-stage disease, some of the incredible canines have also been taught to alert their owners to potentially life-threatening conditions such as epilepsy and diabetes. Mid-way through the display of their work at the Royal Mews, a talented four-year-old Labrador\/Golden Retriever cross called Nimbus realised that his owner, Jodie Griffin, who suffers from a rare condition that causes her to falls unconscious several times a day, was about to have an episode. As the monarch looked on, Nimbus jumped up to warn Jodie, 28, and helped shepherd her to a safe place so she could lie down.","published_at":1528351748,"content_id":"cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d","content_url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/femail\/article-5812067\/The-Queen-accompanied-Camilla-attend-dog-charitys-10th-anniversary-celebrations.html","content_published_at":1528284762,"content_time":1528284762,"content_relative_time":35,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":35,"comment_relative_time":35,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]
