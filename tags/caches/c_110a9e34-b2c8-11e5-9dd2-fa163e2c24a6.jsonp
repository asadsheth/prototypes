Jay Cutler cares very much about playing at a high level, and now there is proof that even his biggest haters can't ignore. Cutler was downright fiery Sunday in Atlanta, chopping a first down signal through the air after connecting with Jarvis Landry on a huge late conversion. The game was tied 17-17 with under five minutes left, and the Dolphins faced third-and-long at the Falcons' 29. An incompletion \u2014 or worse, a sack \u2014 would have set up a challenging field goal for Cody Parkey and left plenty of time for the Falcons to rally. There was no incompletion.

How many games do the Bears have to win for John Fox to keep his job? The surprise implicit in the question is that Fox actually might get to stick around beyond this year. Coach as sacrificial victim is nothing new. A team loses and somebody has to pay. A team loses and loses and, depending on how long his contract is, the coach eventually has to go. There is no proportion or perspective to these things. With just nine victories in 32 games in his first two years there long has been an assumption this season is it for Fox.
