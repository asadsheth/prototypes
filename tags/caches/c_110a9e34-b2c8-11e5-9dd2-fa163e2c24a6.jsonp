If they opt for a different approach in the future, they'll have another target vying to catch quarterback Mitch Trubisky's eye. Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that the Bears have traded a conditional seventh-round pick to the Chargers for Dontrelle Inman. Inman caught 58 passes for 810 yards as a starter for the Chargers last season, but he's seen his playing time drop with Keenan Allen back in action. First-round pick Mike Williams is finally healthy and getting him time would make it even harder for Inman to find a spot in the Chargers lineup.
