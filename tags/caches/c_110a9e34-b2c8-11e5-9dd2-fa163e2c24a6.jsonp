One of those rare occasions when the New York Giants general manager will be available comes Tuesday afternoon, and with this season already having gone horribly off the rails for the 1-6 Giants Reese is likely to be on the defensive when he steps to the podium. The GM has a lot to answer for. Like, his own culpability in a season that had Super Bowl aspirations but is over before Halloween. And, in truth, has been over for a few weeks now. Reese can't be held responsible for the injury that sidelined Odell Beckham Jr. at the beginning of the season and limited his effectiveness when he came back.

So there might not be just one fix for this calendar year. However, if there is one acquisition general Reggie McKenzie can make to help the secondary and to resurrect Oakland's season, what would it be? Here's mine: Jason McCourty The Cleveland Browns are still 0-6 and have shown interest in stockpiling draft selections. Browns cornerback Jason McCourty is having one of the best seasons of his NFL career, 92 Pro Football Focus player grade in 2017 and already had three interceptions in six games this season.

Two questions pop up; which tackle should they move and which landing spot should they pick? While most teams have three or four, Buffalo has five tackles on the roster and four of them are tradeable assets at this point in the season. (Sorry, Conor McDermott.) Big-time left tackle Cordy Glenn, right tackle Jordan Mills, and backup tackles Dion Dawkins and Seantrel Henderson could all have value to the right team, though it's highly unlikely Buffalo would trade Dawkins, who was one of their second round","published_at":1508862060,"content_id":"5a09101f-dfea-358a-90c0-90efbc414eca","content_url":"https:\/\/www.buffalorumblings.com\/2017\/10\/24\/16533530\/nfl-trade-deadline-buffalo-bills-offensive-tackle-cordy-glenn-seantrel-henderson-jordan-mills","content_published_at":1508821200,"content_relative_time":39,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":39,"bot":true}]);
