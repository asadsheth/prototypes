If exploited, the attacker can intercept traffic between devices and Wireless Access Points. However, where traffic is encrypted properly using HTTPS, an attacker cannot look at the traffic and cannot obtain your Wi-Fi password using this vulnerability. Major operating systems including Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS, and Windows are vulnerable to the KRACK.
