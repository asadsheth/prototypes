U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said the federal government did not have to make the payments\u00a0while litigation over the subsidies unfolds. Chhabria, appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, wrote that although the case appeared to be a close call, \"it appears initially that the Trump administration has the stronger legal argument.\" The Trump administration this month terminated the payments to the insurers, which help cover medical expenses for low-income Americans, as part of several moves to dismantle Obama's signature healthcare law formally known as the Affordable Care Act.","published_at":1508975124,"content_id":"6719d846-734d-310d-bf12-e7090ea96abf","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/judge-rejects-bid-18-u-states-revive-obamacare-203900092--sector.html","content_published_at":1508975124,"content_relative_time":16,"vibe_name":"U.S. News","vibe_id":"ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa"}]
