Fenway doesn\u2019t need a upgrade or more seats , it needs a recking ball.","message_id":"bddb8bbd-d2e7-4c0f-b8d5-3d37a44b195f","context_id":"2dff091e-76d5-3b06-b9a8-d0b7a8760267","upvotes":2,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"ro r","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/d21fec84f0092c8a35524fc741c036cf_192.png","author_guid":"XLREMD5HN75WBE3GS7B4EPE65I","score":0.47629367141096,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-3b0ed240-4cee-3b34-a89f-7873e5f7591d_a-2dff091e-76d5-3b06-b9a8-d0b7a8760267","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/dugout-level-seating-coming-fenway-s5kox5w","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"NBC Sports Boston","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/dugout-level-seating-coming-fenway-014157350.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/csnne.com\/fa61dab7a766fdbf63d8b618f0a2e400","title":"Red Sox seek to install dugout-level seating at Fenway Park","summary":"The Red Sox have gotten the approval from the city of Boston to install dugout-style seating at Fenway Park and now need the approval from MLB, the Boston Herald reports. \u00a0","published_at":1508982374,"content_id":"2dff091e-76d5-3b06-b9a8-d0b7a8760267","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/dugout-level-seating-coming-fenway-014157350.html","content_published_at":1508982117,"content_relative_time":14,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3"},"created_at":1509023828,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":false},{"text":"So.....

The Rays know this, Major League Baseball knows this, and the government around Tampa knows this. But stadiums don't appear out of midair; they're the result of a drawn-out, multi-step process. On Tuesday, the first step of that process was reached when Hillsborough County (Fla.) commissioner Ken Hagan announced that a site near downtown Tampa has been acquired, and the intention is to build the Rays a new stadium there. Officials from Hillsborough County, which encompasses Tampa and nearby areas, reached a deal to gain control of roughly 14 acres in the Ybor City-Channel District area near downtown Tampa. The Rays' current home stadium is Tropicana Field, which opened its doors in 1990 and is located in St. Petersburg, roughly 23 miles from the newly proposed site. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled about the possibilities that exist about this location,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cThe site has unlimited potential not only for a state of the art ballpark, but it will also catalyze significant economic development.\u201dA rendering of a potential stadium at the site shows a ballpark squeezed between Channelside Drive on the west and North 15th Street on the east, leaving space for virtually no parking or surrounding attractions.Ybor City is more accessible by public transit than Tropicana Field is, a fact that has made the neighborhood a preferred site for a ball club that has ranked worst or near-worst in attendance in recent years. While site selection is a crucial step toward building a stadium, the Rays' quest for a new home is far from complete. The next and perhaps most difficult step is finding funding for a stadium that is projected to cost roughly $600 million. Tampa Bay isn't the only baseball club looking for a new home; a preferred site for a new stadium aimed at keeping the Athletics in Oakland was announced in September.","published_at":1508896114,"content_id":"64d92661-0316-3cc9-a7a2-709c9ba0c678","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/near-downtown-tampa-selected-potential-224339482.html","content_published_at":1508885019,"content_relative_time":41,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3"},"created_at":1508985922,"comment_relative_time":13,"bot":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-206151d6-837e-306e-bed7-f836ccaae2f8_a-fb8ed681-42a4-300f-8ef5-b96498a712f5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/babe-ruth-series-part-mlb-18ymzrm","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Detroit News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.detroitnews.com\/story\/entertainment\/television\/2017\/10\/25\/major-league-baseball-mlb-babe-ruth-tv-series-younger-viewers\/106975800\/","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qwRhItgulDnaMosJf8_6GA--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fb8ed681-42a4-300f-8ef5-b96498a712f5-1927309882.jpeg","title":"Babe Ruth series part of MLB push for youth exposure","summary":"Major League Baseball wants to turn its first superstar, New York Yankees slugger Babe Ruth, into TV's next big anti-hero.

Presenting a realistic, flaws-and-all portrait of baseball's historic icon may seem like a risk for a sport that has sought to maintain its upright image as America's pastime.","published_at":1508992012,"content_id":"fb8ed681-42a4-300f-8ef5-b96498a712f5","content_url":"http:\/\/www.detroitnews.com\/story\/entertainment\/television\/2017\/10\/25\/major-league-baseball-mlb-babe-ruth-tv-series-younger-viewers\/106975800\/","content_published_at":1508983081,"content_relative_time":14,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":14,"bot":true},{"text":"I totally agree with all you said.

The Rays know this, Major League Baseball knows this, and the government around Tampa knows this. But stadiums don't appear out of midair; they're the result of a drawn-out, multi-step process. On Tuesday, the first step of that process was reached when Hillsborough County (Fla.) commissioner Ken Hagan announced that a site near downtown Tampa has been acquired, and the intention is to build the Rays a new stadium there. Officials from Hillsborough County, which encompasses Tampa and nearby areas, reached a deal to gain control of roughly 14 acres in the Ybor City-Channel District area near downtown Tampa. The Rays' current home stadium is Tropicana Field, which opened its doors in 1990 and is located in St. Petersburg, roughly 23 miles from the newly proposed site. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled about the possibilities that exist about this location,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cThe site has unlimited potential not only for a state of the art ballpark, but it will also catalyze significant economic development.\u201dA rendering of a potential stadium at the site shows a ballpark squeezed between Channelside Drive on the west and North 15th Street on the east, leaving space for virtually no parking or surrounding attractions.Ybor City is more accessible by public transit than Tropicana Field is, a fact that has made the neighborhood a preferred site for a ball club that has ranked worst or near-worst in attendance in recent years. While site selection is a crucial step toward building a stadium, the Rays' quest for a new home is far from complete. The next and perhaps most difficult step is finding funding for a stadium that is projected to cost roughly $600 million. Tampa Bay isn't the only baseball club looking for a new home; a preferred site for a new stadium aimed at keeping the Athletics in Oakland was announced in September.","published_at":1508896114,"content_id":"64d92661-0316-3cc9-a7a2-709c9ba0c678","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/near-downtown-tampa-selected-potential-224339482.html","content_published_at":1508885019,"content_relative_time":41,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3"},"created_at":1508928868,"comment_relative_time":29,"bot":false},{"text":"But don't Millennials only watch TV for the commercials?","message_id":"26daaa30-b37d-442f-9ceb-199fc075f700","context_id":"8d0e3a4c-da00-3378-b17b-1f3987e83c35","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Deviser","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ald.jpg","author_guid":"LCOER6326YOBYYSPRZ3QBNM4W4","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-167459a6-1913-382d-a034-01691dfadbc7_a-8d0e3a4c-da00-3378-b17b-1f3987e83c35","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/2017-world-series-advertising-rubicon-62tl6p3","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/2017-world-series-advertising-rubicon-141330634.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/nbcsports.com\/714daea7bb8bf3708fff3f05954ec188","title":"The 2017 World Series: when the advertising Rubicon was crossed","summary":"Major League Baseballs pursuit of advertising dollars is beginning to intrude upon the game itself","published_at":1508941034,"content_id":"8d0e3a4c-da00-3378-b17b-1f3987e83c35","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/2017-world-series-advertising-rubicon-141330634.html","content_published_at":1508941424,"content_relative_time":26,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3"},"created_at":1508949707,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-a277be6e-cfb3-3a16-acb6-eb81afdc7ff7_a-993ca36e-d225-38d8-bc4f-bdbee5836354","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-a277be6e-cfb3-3a16-acb6-eb81afdc7ff7_a-993ca36e-d225-38d8-bc4f-bdbee5836354","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"USA Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/life\/entertainthis\/2017\/10\/25\/lady-gaga-kirsten-dunst-more-celebrities-turn-out-world-series-game-1\/797935001\/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatoday-lifetopstories","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/r6w_qXbPDKXR76A2Kc7OwQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_993ca36e-d225-38d8-bc4f-bdbee5836354-1079032660.jpeg","title":"Lady Gaga, Kirsten Dunst, more celebrities turn out for World Series Game 1","summary":"The Los Angeles Dodgers locked up the first game of the World Series against the Houston Astros at Dodger Stadium Tuesday\u00a0in front of an audience packed with star power.
