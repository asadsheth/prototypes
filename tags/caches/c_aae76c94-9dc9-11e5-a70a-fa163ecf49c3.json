I've hit similar homeruns in little league, highschool, and some college.  When you have a guy throwing a ball at 90+ mph and you make some kind of contact, it's gonna fly for a while.  Might have been an awkward swing, but he got a lot of bat on the ball.  I used to suck at hitting.  I focused more on fielding anyway.  But one year in highschool I actually had a decent coach who noticed that when I swung, I seemed to put everything I had into it.  Basically, swinging too hard, and spinning myself into a ditch.  A very awkward form.  He pulled me aside one day and advised me to just slow down, and swing naturally, nice and easy.  That the pitcher will do the work.  All I needed to concentrate on was making contact, and \"going with the pitch\", meaning do what you can with what the pitcher gives you.  \"Oh, and don't miss his mistakes\" he added with a chuckle.  I worked on my swing all summer.  Came back and led my team in avg with .368 and OBP.  Also increased my walks and cut my strikeouts in half because I was waiting and seeing more of the pitch, rather than just gearing up and swinging for the fences.  I also hit 10 that season, twice my total the year before, and 2nd on the team.  Not bad for a second baseman.","message_id":"a7441e41-ad04-4ded-b985-94e7aaa98eee","context_id":"cc3c108e-9e46-37a1-91f4-e84e9dde7989","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Jack","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"X26W7PGJAWZVME47VKTTTOFLHU","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-31c942bc-3afd-3219-a09a-789da15a9f9b_a-cc3c108e-9e46-37a1-91f4-e84e9dde7989","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/todd-frazier-hits-unlikely-home-run-baseballs-postseason-3jqplwz","author":"Mike","provider":"Big League Stew","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/todd-frazier-hits-unlikely-home-run-baseballs-postseason-012348210.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/9fc3811575aece5afb645d11fa7d2c32","title":"Todd Frazier hits the most unlikely home run of baseball's postseason","summary":"Yankees third baseman Todd Frazier took advantage of the short porch at Yankee Stadium with this unlikely home run.","published_at":1508203448,"content_id":"cc3c108e-9e46-37a1-91f4-e84e9dde7989","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/todd-frazier-hits-unlikely-home-run-baseballs-postseason-012348210.html","content_published_at":1508203428,"content_relative_time":22,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3"},"created_at":1508213484,"comment_relative_time":19,"bot":false},{"text":"No mention if the designated hitter would still be there in a combined league.

Neither Frazier's nor Judge's \"home run\" would be more than a long fly out in most ballparks. Idiots from New York will defend their band box and claim that Frazier's 343 would go out in most stadiums. Well, maybe if they were hit right down the line. Real major league ballparks are over 325 down the lines and fall away quickly so straghtaway LF or RF, where the two HRs landed, would be 350 to 360 in decent parks falling to 385 or 390 in the power alleys. That would make these balls simple flies that fell short of the warning track. Some other idiots are boasting about Judge's defensive prowess. Why? It is about 145 feet to the collar of the infield between 1B and 2B. If you hit the ball barely over twice that far then it leaves the park. Judge has less room to defend than do my dogs in the back yard.  Nobody's defense has been so over-hyped since Ken Griffey Jr in the Kingdome where the actual CF wall was 395 but had \"410\" painted on it for some reason.
