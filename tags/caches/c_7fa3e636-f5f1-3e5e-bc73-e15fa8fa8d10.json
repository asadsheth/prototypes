The magnetic suspension should make it more comfortable for everyday driving, and the ability to quiet the engine when you are coming home late and don't want to aggravate the neighbors is also a plus.

Driverless cars is such a leap forward in innovating that the majority of people are so astounded of its idea actually working, most fear if it can actually work because of how innovative it is. But that can be said about almost every electronic and technical breakthrough since early 1900s. Anything that exist around the time you are born is considered normal, anything that exist before you are 25 is considered a breakthough, and anything that exist after to are 35 is against the natural order of things. so to sum it up, the older we get the more fearsome we are to new technology because of our own unwillingness to adapt and adjust to technological advancements and ideals past a certain point in our lives when we are pretty much settled in what we have learned, and refuse to change.","id":"904b7e83-8276-42b1-8fef-af6f823197d3","context_id":"5920f17d-4da8-3b40-ab0d-00b0951a37f9","upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"TURTLE MAN","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_TM_nl.jpg","score":0.52753718344348,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-959dce30-df5f-3af9-a57a-b9af0a616949_a-5920f17d-4da8-3b40-ab0d-00b0951a37f9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/california-dmv-changes-rules-allow-24fjxr0","author":"nanook","provider":"TechCrunch","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/california-dmv-changes-rules-allow-160317527.html","img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/slick-70226-1507750846364.jpg","title":"California DMV changes rules to allow testing and use of fully autonomous vehicles","summary":"The California Department of Motor Vehicles is changing its rules to allow companies to test autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel -- and to let the public use autonomous vehicles.","published_at":1507732418,"content_id":"5920f17d-4da8-3b40-ab0d-00b0951a37f9","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/california-dmv-changes-rules-allow-160317527.html","content_published_at":1507737797,"content_relative_time":23,"vibe_name":"Transportation"},"created_at":1507760883,"comment_relative_time":17,"bot":false},{"text":"Scrolled through some of the comments and wonder what people said about horseless carriages when they first arrived?
