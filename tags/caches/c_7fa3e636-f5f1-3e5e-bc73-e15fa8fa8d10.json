Instead, we are stuck on a siding outside Creston, Iowa, awaiting a passing BNSF westbound freight train. Several similar stopover delays as Amtrak or freight trains push the Zephyr to sidings means we will arrive at Chicago's Union Station more than two hours behind schedule. It is a common occurrence during a near 5,000-mile trek that began at Union Station, when we boarded the westbound Empire Builder to Seattle, switched trains in the Emerald City, headed south on the Coast Starlight to San Francisco and, akin to hobos, jumped the Zephyr eastward to the Windy City.","published_at":1507567920,"content_id":"153c0810-fa86-3906-adf4-9a5556da2158","content_url":"http:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/suburbs\/lake-county-news-sun\/opinion\/ct-lns-selle-rail-funding-st-1010-20171009-story.html","content_published_at":1507562820,"content_relative_time":6,"vibe_name":"Transportation"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":true}]
