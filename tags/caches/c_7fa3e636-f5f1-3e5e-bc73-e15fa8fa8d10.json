The Tesla's electric motors can produce massive amounts of torque right off the line, which means that any gas engine isn't going to come close to the 0-60 times. But Top Gear wanted to thoroughly test the limits of the Tesla's speed, so they put it up against a Mercedes E63 AMG 4-door sedan, the answer to every engineer's question of \"how far is too far.\" https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/topgear\/videos\/vb.282681245570\/10159643278165571\/ The result really isn't surprising at all: the Tesla takes the Mercedes by a couple car-lengths. It beat it off the line, and there wasn't really a hope of a comeback at any point. If the race had been twice as long, the Mercedes may well have caught up -- electric cars suck at extremely high speeds, where air resistance is more of a factor -- but over a standard drag-race distance, it's humbling to see just how fast the Tesla is. The video did showcase one other thing, though: Tesla's aren't nearly as reliable or intuitive as the gas-powered cars. We've been conditioned by years of driving to expect certain controls and processes, and by all accounts, driving a Tesla is a big change.

Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason.  You would have to pull to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue.\nFor some reason you would simply accept this.\n4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.\n5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but would run on only five percent of the roads.\n6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single \"This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation\" warning light.\n7. The airbag system would ask \"Are you sure?\" before deploying.\n8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.\n9. Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.\n10.

The record is under 7 minutes, and many cars ahead of it cannot match the Tesla's 0-60 time.","message_id":"d9f4e2a5-e81a-4ffd-8009-6f120daca3d3","context_id":"98d8b5fe-9409-3204-b8ea-eb4b0aa23692","upvotes":5,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":4,"author_name":"Mark","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_M_jd_1_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"TM676WFHVRW4B53X5D32KRGXKI","score":0.56100677023361,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-f61d03fe-bcb2-3255-be8c-e081fb365a67_a-98d8b5fe-9409-3204-b8ea-eb4b0aa23692","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/top-gear-raced-tesla-100d-against-mercedes-sedan-143seru","author":"third_watch","provider":"BGR News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/top-gear-raced-tesla-100d-against-mercedes-sedan-000033878.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/BGR_News\/top-gear.png","title":"\u2018Top Gear\u2019 raced a Tesla 100D against a Mercedes sedan, and you\u2019ll totally believe what happened next","summary":"At this point, drag-racing a Tesla Model S P100D against [insert gas-powered car here] is a foregone conclusion.

The Tesla's electric motors can produce massive amounts of torque right off the line, which means that any gas engine isn't going to come close to the 0-60 times. But Top Gear wanted to thoroughly test the limits of the Tesla's speed, so they put it up against a Mercedes E63 AMG 4-door sedan, the answer to every engineer's question of \"how far is too far.\" https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/topgear\/videos\/vb.282681245570\/10159643278165571\/ The result really isn't surprising at all: the Tesla takes the Mercedes by a couple car-lengths. It beat it off the line, and there wasn't really a hope of a comeback at any point. If the race had been twice as long, the Mercedes may well have caught up -- electric cars suck at extremely high speeds, where air resistance is more of a factor -- but over a standard drag-race distance, it's humbling to see just how fast the Tesla is. The video did showcase one other thing, though: Tesla's aren't nearly as reliable or intuitive as the gas-powered cars. We've been conditioned by years of driving to expect certain controls and processes, and by all accounts, driving a Tesla is a big change. That showed up here, as the driver of the Tesla had to turn the car off and on again just to get it to start.","published_at":1508371531,"content_id":"98d8b5fe-9409-3204-b8ea-eb4b0aa23692","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/top-gear-raced-tesla-100d-against-mercedes-sedan-000033878.html","content_published_at":1508371233,"content_relative_time":23,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10"},"created_at":1508417383,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":false},{"text":"Nissan Rogue to passenger: so you don't agree with Hillary, the doors will automatically lock down, and the self destruct mode has now been enabled, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 , 4, 3, agree yet?","message_id":"6fea030b-8fa1-46d2-aa54-d05317f615ac","context_id":"25c93278-f35e-3a4f-a1e3-24815caadbdc","upvotes":2,"downvotes":4,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Jesse James","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"KGLV2S5LM3J3I27K45PKX57PJQ","score":0.36818459892482,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-a455f351-6d5d-3cbe-9f3c-58755ae5b0b4_a-25c93278-f35e-3a4f-a1e3-24815caadbdc","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/nissan-apos-rogue-first-us-4tcdxh8","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Engadget","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/nissan-apos-rogue-first-us-050200629.html","img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/slick-73507-1508429306339.jpg","title":"Nissan's Rogue is its first US car with semi-autonomous driving","summary":"You won't have to wait long to try Nissan's semi-autonomous ProPilot Assist on American streets.","published_at":1508389629,"content_id":"25c93278-f35e-3a4f-a1e3-24815caadbdc","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/nissan-apos-rogue-first-us-050200629.html","content_published_at":1508389320,"content_relative_time":18,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10"},"created_at":1508419791,"comment_relative_time":9,"bot":false},{"text":"Chinese people always have lots of new inventive, creative ideas!\nAmerican become the No  No  IMPOSSIBLE people.
