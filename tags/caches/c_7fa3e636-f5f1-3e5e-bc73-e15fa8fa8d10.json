The car maker's stock price has risen about 18.5 percent over the past month, according to FactSet data, closing at nearly $45 on Thursday. The price has gotten ahead of itself, Jonas said, but it has opened up a limited window for General Motors and other auto companies to create new entities to fuel currency for partnerships and talent acquisition.
