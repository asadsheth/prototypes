One is by cracking natural gas; which is stupid because you are turning a high energy content substance into a low energy content substance; better to just burn the natural gas directly in an internal combustion engine or use it to fuel electric power plants. The other method of H2 production is electrolysis of water which is using electricity to separate the oxygen from the hydrogen (H2) which is then used to make electricity using fuel-cells. The efficiency of this cycle is pretty sad.

First of all, passenger cars make up a relatively small amount of carbon dioxide emissions. If all of the cars on the planet were electric tomorrow, it would reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by about 2%.  Second, it's the sales of gas powered vehicles that are subsidizing the production of electric cars. For example, General Motors, which apparently is doubling down on it's legacy of building cars that people don't want, is planning to increase significantly it's production of electric cars, which  it currently loses about $9,000 per vehicle. Now that's intelligent; cut back on light trucks and SUV's which are profitable, and focus on money-losing electric cars. Third, as history continues to show, countries or states where electric vehicle subsidies are cut or reduced, sales of electric cars plummet. Without the subsidies, the electric car industry is dead on arrival.","message_id":"2174bada-21d6-4fb9-a173-f32ca46c81aa","context_id":"0afe7c93-2dd7-3082-9b9a-04214b2a6ff4","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Jon E.

Realize the American public  struggle with day to day expenses and most of us can;t handle a $600 plus dollar payment a month for 7 years, Its crazy when a car payment is close to a house payment if you were to try and do a 3 or 4 year loan hence WHY over the past decade the finance options have HAD to push to 5 years,  6 years  then 7 years financing, No that you've exhausted that trick to make it seem affordable whats next?  .  Your workers make way more than the average person does and maybe your stuck in your own little world thinking its that way everywhere  but its not. Perhaps used the McDonald's theory. Instead of charging a fortune, try offering excellent deals selling many more and ,making a little off each item.","message_id":"d3785c7b-16ac-401c-bd08-975a1de3aac6","context_id":"f38c0b9e-3cc9-333f-a040-01b04e2506d3","upvotes":7,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Jeff","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"HO26D2EVB5KQ7G7EVL4YWMLHWU","score":0.74465315323989,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-a2f8b413-fdca-3ff4-b572-99266e86b1b7_a-f38c0b9e-3cc9-333f-a040-01b04e2506d3","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/gm-reportedly-cut-production-detroit-5mt1bwl","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Autoblog","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/gm-reportedly-cut-production-detroit-135500167.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/autoblog_50\/1ce7a45d146e2ff72c89cc2aff391763","title":"GM reportedly will cut production at Detroit-area plant, lay off 1,500","summary":"Hamtramck plant will close for six weeks, then reopen with lower production.","published_at":1507810749,"content_id":"f38c0b9e-3cc9-333f-a040-01b04e2506d3","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/gm-reportedly-cut-production-detroit-135500167.html","content_published_at":1507816500,"content_relative_time":33,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10"},"created_at":1507894362,"comment_relative_time":11,"bot":false},{"text":"Meanwhile Honda, Toyota and Kia build all there cars here while Ford, GM and Chrysler build 90% in Mexico.

Particularly since there is no need to figure out how to recycle old battery packs.  Plus, the hydrogen vehicles with the right fuel cell design will be able to travel much farther on \"a tank of hydrogen\".  The technology is already in practice in other countries.
