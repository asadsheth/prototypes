The answer is simple: The Obama administration mandated a hike in the fleet CAFE standards from 35MPG to 54.5MPG by 2025. The industry complained bitterly, but would be fined billions for every MPG they fall short so they've begun replacing traditional six cylinder engines with problem-prone turbocharged fours.\n\nThe new Trump administration has pledged to undo the 54.5MPG rule and discuss some compromised above 35MPG in its place. Perhaps we will see six-cylinders come back then.
