One problem is that it will slowly leak from any tank you put it in, because the molecules are so small.  So you can't leave a (fuelled) vehicle doing nothing. for several days.  Another problem is that to get enough hydrogen into a manageably small volume you have to use extremely high pressure, and that brings serious safety concerns.  And if you do have a bad leak, hydrogen forms an explosive mixture with air over a very wide range of concentrations.   And to add to the fun, hydrogen burns with an invisible flame, so you could walk right into a fire because you couldn't see that it was there.","message_id":"88d0465e-a14a-46da-8dee-af2cd34ab3b7","context_id":"bbd4f501-a2d3-3620-b1fe-5b72375bdcca","upvotes":15,"downvotes":10,"reports":0,"replies":9,"author_name":"Linda Sutherland","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_L_ad.jpg","score":0.61391254563732,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-447c6c45-a80d-32b1-a17a-f12873356eff_a-bbd4f501-a2d3-3620-b1fe-5b72375bdcca","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/toyota-fuel-cell-big-rigs-2ldzx8d","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Engadget","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/toyota-fuel-cell-big-rigs-130000639.html","img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/slick-70479-1507822548236.jpg","title":"Toyota\u2019s fuel-cell big rigs are ready to haul cargo","summary":"After completing 4,000 \"development\" miles at the port of Los Angeles, Toyota's Project Portal hydrogen fuel-cell big rig is ready to start transporting cargo from that port and the one in Long Beach to rail yards and warehouses beginning on October 23.","published_at":1507813516,"content_id":"bbd4f501-a2d3-3620-b1fe-5b72375bdcca","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/toyota-fuel-cell-big-rigs-130000639.html","content_published_at":1507813200,"content_relative_time":3,"vibe_name":"Transportation"},"created_at":1507814762,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":false},{"text":"why cant they bring hydrogen across the country its only in like LA, SF just in California.","message_id":"a7c1e54a-3203-44fd-a228-347300289635","context_id":"bbd4f501-a2d3-3620-b1fe-5b72375bdcca","upvotes":5,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Firewalker","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_F_kl_6-16.jpg","score":0.59805110735417,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-447c6c45-a80d-32b1-a17a-f12873356eff_a-bbd4f501-a2d3-3620-b1fe-5b72375bdcca","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/toyota-fuel-cell-big-rigs-2ldzx8d","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Engadget","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/toyota-fuel-cell-big-rigs-130000639.html","img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/slick-70479-1507822548236.jpg","title":"Toyota\u2019s fuel-cell big rigs are ready to haul cargo","summary":"After completing 4,000 \"development\" miles at the port of Los Angeles, Toyota's Project Portal hydrogen fuel-cell big rig is ready to start transporting cargo from that port and the one in Long Beach to rail yards and warehouses beginning on October 23.","published_at":1507813516,"content_id":"bbd4f501-a2d3-3620-b1fe-5b72375bdcca","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/toyota-fuel-cell-big-rigs-130000639.html","content_published_at":1507813200,"content_relative_time":3,"vibe_name":"Transportation"},"created_at":1507815001,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":false},{"text":"Momma Hilthon.

A Tesla Model 3 has appeared in a Craigslist post from Monterey, California. The car allegedly has about 2,000 miles on the odometer. As with every other Model 3 in production, it's a long-range version with the 310-mile battery, and other features include the panoramic glass roof, upgraded sound system and \"Aero\" wheels. The seller notes that \"a unique circumstance\" spurred the for-sale posting. It's currently listed for $150,000, or approximately 3 times the car's initial cost.

The coolest bit is that the carbon fiber AeroWagen hatch is a straight swap for the stock rear hatch of the current C7 Corvette. The modification will bump the 'Vette's cargo capacity by a couple of cubic feet, but perhaps more importantly, it transforms what was already one of the best-looking front-engined","published_at":1507753500,"content_id":"266d3617-e59e-3912-880d-23e1bb41be21","content_url":"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/cars\/2017\/10\/callaways-757hp-aerowagen-might-be-the-coolest-corvette-ever\/","content_published_at":1507725000,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Transportation"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-5cb5f341-4cd4-376d-b5a9-033049507760_a-c0a69a67-4560-31a7-9b3c-5a74dc56823c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/10-fastest-pickup-trucks-grace-1bb731f","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The Cheat Sheet","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cheatsheet.com\/automobiles\/the-planets-10-fastest-pickup-trucks.html\/?ref=YF&yptr=yahoo","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/wscs.com\/84e615a8971bd336ea604ee1ee8d5096","title":"10 Fastest Pickup Trucks to Grace the World\u2019s Roads","summary":"The world is full of incredibly quick vehicles -- just not that many are trucks.
