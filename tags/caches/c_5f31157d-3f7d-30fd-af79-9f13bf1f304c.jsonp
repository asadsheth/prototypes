He has drawn a lot of attention to himself, and that makes it hard to hide from reality.\u201d The fugitive eventually surrendered to police, fulfilling his promise by arriving at the station with doughnuts and a bagel. \u201cZaydel made good on his promise to turn himself in to RTPD for his outstanding warrants,\u201d the department said. \u201cHe walked in on his own, and not only did he bring the doughnuts, he brought one bagel!
