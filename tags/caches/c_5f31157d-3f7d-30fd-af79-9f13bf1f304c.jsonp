To some of our readers' credit, the Penguins probably never should've retained a top-five spot after their 10-1 debacle of a loss to the Chicago Blackhawks, so even their recent on-ice improvement appears in this week's edition as a demotion to the middle of the pack.","published_at":1508208622,"content_id":"0f8e82d9-84f6-3fa6-82dc-1e7ead85976b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.cbssports.com\/nhl\/news\/nhl-power-rankings-maple-leafs-ascend-to-the-top-as-oilers-struggles-continue\/","content_published_at":1508180820,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture","vibe_id":"5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true}]);
