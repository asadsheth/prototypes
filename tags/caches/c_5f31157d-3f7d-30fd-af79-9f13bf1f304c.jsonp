My word of advice, outlaw any more white males from being born for the next 100 years. Women who give birth to a male child with 2 white parents should automatically abort it. If we create a balance and make white males a lower population, these senseless acts of rape & mass shootings will slow down. Unlike crimes committed in city areas that's caused by poverty & a struggling economy, we can't pinpoint what makes white males tick, so it has to be a natural dna disorder.","message_id":"f07da53b-18ae-48f7-a88a-1b3a09452394","context_id":"6b706bc6-5050-33d7-9693-c126a22be1ec","upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Diamante","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/38f620356a123301739d827a5326e9b8_192.jpeg","author_guid":"MG7OZZL2G2PBQ2UUNQAPVITT3I","score":0.68779555511953,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-c05ccecd-5ec8-3237-bc65-ca6bb560cb16_a-6b706bc6-5050-33d7-9693-c126a22be1ec","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/woman-raped-neighbor-then-offered-57tp4qq","author":"third_watch","provider":"Inside Edition","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/woman-raped-neighbor-then-offered-002112569.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/inside_edition\/3118e0f68cdfedaa9e113125f8f40a77","title":"Woman Raped By Neighbor, Who Then Offered to Do Yard Work: Cops","summary":"An 18-year-old raped his neighbor, then offered to do lawn chores to make it up to her, cops say.","published_at":1507765740,"content_id":"6b706bc6-5050-33d7-9693-c126a22be1ec","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/woman-raped-neighbor-then-offered-002112569.html","content_published_at":1507767660,"content_relative_time":46,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture","vibe_id":"5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c"},"created_at":1507933174,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"Whether male or female I doubt this thug will ever be safe to be released, also I am fed up with people refusing to leave their cells and face the court, chain them and if needed drag them in to receive their sentence.","message_id":"6cd884ef-f8c4-458d-b7e4-6d07237bc0bb","context_id":"9b0b5805-8e6b-3b77-aa35-c35325dcc4cb","upvotes":471,"downvotes":5,"reports":0,"replies":14,"author_name":"Robert T","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_RT_ald.jpg","author_guid":"I6DZ3R5MKDJL3LLNIRBTC724PY","score":0.98606069475852,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-bbda9c6b-31f0-319b-b9fd-61c651eb5aaa_a-9b0b5805-8e6b-3b77-aa35-c35325dcc4cb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/bullying-woman-sent-prison-20-years-battering-girlfriend-death-297pj5l","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Yahoo News UK","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/bullying-woman-sent-prison-20-years-battering-girlfriend-death-131015983.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/8ebfffc2edfd51a2ce072373735e5f93","title":"Bullying woman sent to prison for 20 years after 'battering' her girlfriend to death","summary":"A bullying woman Becky Reid, 32, who murdered her girlfriend, mother-of-one Lyndsey Vaux, 30, by giving her a 'massive battering' has been sent to jail for at least 20 years.","published_at":1507898239,"content_id":"9b0b5805-8e6b-3b77-aa35-c35325dcc4cb","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/bullying-woman-sent-prison-20-years-battering-girlfriend-death-131015983.html","content_published_at":1507900215,"content_relative_time":9,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture","vibe_id":"5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c"},"created_at":1507902878,"comment_relative_time":9,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"I'm surprised they have that option.
