Their original claim to fame was electrical and electronic TEST equipment.  Computers for them came much later.  Real key players were Fairchild, National Semiconductor, Intel, Xerox, Memorex.  IBM was there but not in the valley but in a suburb of San Jose where they developed all kinds of Disk Drives.  Apple came much later with their first product being for hobbyists. Xerox had a large research facility called PARC up in Stanford where they came up with the STAR computer system that they showed to Steve Jobs. It used ICONS on a screen to navigate. Next thing you know Apple and then Microsoft was using it. One item about HP, many of my engineering friends loved working there, why?  The working environment was good and Bill and Dave had put in place very early on, a very generous PROFIT SHARING PLAN. \nStanford and Berkley were a great engineering resource.  The ARPA net connected Stanford's computers to computers at other universities like MIT. This was the real precursor to the internet. A company called TYMESHARE developed a PACKET SWITCHING system that was key to making the internet we know work.  And then there was the development of a device to control a computer at Stanford University. Today we call it a MOUSE.\nAm sure I left some out, but this 80-year-old brain is getting tired.","message_id":"183157e2-9ff7-4821-8df6-ff2c4bcf1501","context_id":"f0174835-4424-357f-a368-b71b4ac5c212","upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Don","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ald.jpg","author_guid":"DMHMHBRITJRXRUJYLS6CAOAOWQ","score":0.59722425808824,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-9c4dd5d6-cf10-38ba-ac48-45ce9402000d_a-f0174835-4424-357f-a368-b71b4ac5c212","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/hp-lost-key-historical-archives-4it6mbi","author":"third_watch","provider":"Engadget","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/hp-lost-key-historical-archives-233300744.html","img":null,"title":"HP lost key historical archives in California's wildfires","summary":"There's no question that California's recent wildfires are ultimately a human tragedy, destroying homes and upturning lives.","published_at":1509320235,"content_id":"f0174835-4424-357f-a368-b71b4ac5c212","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/hp-lost-key-historical-archives-233300744.html","content_published_at":1509319980,"content_relative_time":137,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4"},"created_at":1509344908,"comment_relative_time":130,"bot":false},{"text":"No one cares, HP is history.
