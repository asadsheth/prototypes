After the strong wage growth figure in Friday's jobs report, traders now give a greater than 90 percent chance of a rate hike at the Federal Reserve's Dec. 12-13 , according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, CNBC found the best sector performers two months before a December rate hike, which are actually pretty rare, occurring just four times since 1990. Financials were up every time and posted an average return greater than 10 percent.

No, not San Francisco, as some might expect. According to a new report by WalletHub, Frisco, Texas, tops the list of the fastest-growing cities in America due to its rapid job and population growth. The Dallas suburb is home to the Dallas Cowboys headquarters and National Videogame Museum. To determine where the most rapid local economic growth occurred from 2010 to 2016, WalletHub analysts compared 515 U.S. cities of varying sizes across 15 key metrics. The data ranges from job growth to population growth, and median household income growth to median house price growth. The Lone Star State is well-represented on the finance website's list.

U-17 World Cup: Mali look to register 1st win of tournament against Turkey","summary":"Tipped as favourites to qualify from Group B, Mali find themselves in a precarious situation with a defeat on Monday likely to send the runners-up of the previous edition of the FIFA U-17 World Cup out of the tournament. In what was billed as a clash between the two top sides of the group, Mali had gone down to Paraguay 2-3 despite levelling things at 2-2 at one point. While their comeback had indeed been impressive, their frail defence line that fell apart in the first 17 minutes will be a cause of concern for the African champions. Against Turkey, they face a tricky opponent who are yet to unleash their full potential.
