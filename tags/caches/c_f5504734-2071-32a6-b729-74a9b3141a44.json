Germany who also screams the loudest about how NATO must protect them from Russian aggression.\n\nIn 1985, North Korea managed to circumvent US export-control barriers to purchase 87 civilian-type Hughes MD 500s from a West German export firm (the purchase was conducted covertly) before the US government learnt of the illegal action by North Korea and moved to stop further deliveries to the country. There are reports indicating that at least sixty of the helicopters delivered to North Korea were modified to serve as helicopter-gunships. As South Korea produces the MD 500 domestically (under license) for use by its own armed forces, the modified helicopters operated by North Korea were deemed useful in conducting covert or deceptive operations against South Korea (such as incursions past the border).[5]\n\nThe modified MD 500 helicopters were finally revealed by North Korea and seen by the USA and European countries during North Korea's Victory Parade held on the 27th of July in 2013 in Pyongyang, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean War in 1953.

U-17 World Cup: Mali look to register 1st win of tournament against Turkey","summary":"Tipped as favourites to qualify from Group B, Mali find themselves in a precarious situation with a defeat on Monday likely to send the runners-up of the previous edition of the FIFA U-17 World Cup out of the tournament. In what was billed as a clash between the two top sides of the group, Mali had gone down to Paraguay 2-3 despite levelling things at 2-2 at one point. While their comeback had indeed been impressive, their frail defence line that fell apart in the first 17 minutes will be a cause of concern for the African champions. Against Turkey, they face a tricky opponent who are yet to unleash their full potential.

After the strong wage growth figure in Friday's jobs report, traders now give a greater than 90 percent chance of a rate hike at the Federal Reserve's Dec. 12-13 , according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, CNBC found the best sector performers two months before a December rate hike, which are actually pretty rare, occurring just four times since 1990. Financials were up every time and posted an average return greater than 10 percent.
