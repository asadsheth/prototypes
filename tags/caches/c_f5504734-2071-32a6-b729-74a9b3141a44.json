One is that they can't imagine a huge number of Americans\u2014especially those in the Trump tribe\u2014actually sitting down and meditating. The other reason people laugh at this salvation scenario is that they think the point of meditation is to cultivate love or compassion or some other warm and fuzzy feeling that might heal the nation.

Set in the United States in December 2003 \u2013 when U.S. forces in Iraq were dragging Saddam Hussein out of a \"spider hole\" - it is the story of three ageing former servicemen who reunite to bury the son of one of them who has been killed in action. With President Donald Trump saying he could \"totally destroy\" North Korea and characterising a dinner with military commanders as \"the calm before the storm\", Cranston said \"Last Flag Flying\" was a timely reminder of the effect on normal Americans of ill-advised military campaigns.","published_at":1507491922,"content_id":"6692a4a5-ed8a-3908-9910-2d73d9db5ffe","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/music\/linklaters-war-veteran-comedy-speaks-modern-america-says-194734083--finance.html","content_published_at":1507492054,"content_relative_time":21,"vibe_name":"United States"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":21,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-4f4f2cf4-c4ea-3082-947f-c5413772adc4_a-d0b163e8-ec7f-34bd-af2b-265bff66904a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/us-partially-suspends-visa-services-4mesnxu","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"The Independent","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/us-partially-suspends-visa-services-220543197.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_635\/bd48bbde67352258fc6217c9a0452488","title":"US partially suspends visa services in Turkey following diplomatic row","summary":"The US has announced it is reducing visa services at its diplomatic facilities in Turkey for security reasons after one of its employees was detained at the Turkish consulate.

Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, CNBC found the best sector performers two months before a December rate hike, which are actually pretty rare, occurring just four times since 1990.
