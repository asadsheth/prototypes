I could understand his decision to use three forwards (namely Altidore, Woods, and Pulisic) as well as defensively weak Nagbe in the Panama match because (1) the Americans were playing on their home soil, (2) a win against Panama was essential, and (3) the Americans needed to score as many goals as possible because goal-differential was a tie breaker.  Once Arena got what he wanted from the Panama match, selecting the same lineup in the T&T game was madness.  Not only was the T&T match an away game, all that was now needed was a 0:0 tie.  Nagbe may be the worst left midfielder in the last 3 decades I\u2019ve been following the USA team.  There are times he looks really good moving forward. Having said that, he disappears for long stretches of most matches. That\u2019s why Klinsmann didn\u2019t like him.  Not only does Nagbe refuse to play defense, when he moves forward from the left side of the field he always goes to his right thereby clogging up the middle of the field making it easy for T&T to defend in front of their goal.  I suspect that the reason why Nagbe always does this is because he can\u2019t cross the ball.  When he\u2019s on the field, there is no width to the team. Worse, he leaves the left side of the mid field exposed when he moves into the center of the field.  Taylor Twellman and Adrian Healey pointed out how exposed Bradley was in the Panama game due to Nagbe\u2019s poor defensive abilities and his tendency to leave his position. Both warned that an adjustment was needed for the T&T match, especially since all that was needed was a tie.  Give the T&T coach credit seeing how open Nagbe\u2019s part of the field was.  Both T&T goals were started from their right side, attacking the hole on America\u2019s left were Nagbe should have been.  Finally, I can\u2019t really blame Nagbe. He is what he is.  He\u2019s not going to change.  Arena should have started a more defensive midfielder.  That was his first blunder.  At least he should have seen what was going on before T&T scored  their first goal.  That he didn\u2019t pull Nagbe until a few minutes before the end of the match was his second blunder.","id":"a472a05b-312b-44a8-8816-05ea161c5f83","context_id":"62bb26a1-6db2-3f54-a95a-538285ca0224","upvotes":24,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":9,"author_name":"Rigoberto","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_nl.jpg","score":0.83424453050098,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-77e60248-f33c-32d3-a817-3ff6171230c5_a-62bb26a1-6db2-3f54-a95a-538285ca0224","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-77e60248-f33c-32d3-a817-3ff6171230c5_a-62bb26a1-6db2-3f54-a95a-538285ca0224","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Goal.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/usa-hits-embarrassing-low-failing-043228044.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/uk.goal.com\/5ea348abb7529dda037f64e3c2be7e5b","title":"USA hits an embarrassing low after failing to qualify for World Cup","summary":"The U.S. didn't qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986, and the failure falls on the shoulders of players and management","published_at":1507731221,"content_id":"62bb26a1-6db2-3f54-a95a-538285ca0224","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/usa-hits-embarrassing-low-failing-043228044.html","content_published_at":1507696348,"content_relative_time":14,"vibe_name":"United States"},"created_at":1507704663,"comment_relative_time":11,"bot":false},{"text":"Erdogan has made Turkey a lost cause, time to pick up our nukes and leave","id":"40d474d3-f8e1-4aef-96b0-48c06fe2c968","context_id":"2873717a-19bd-312b-9f5b-e7c3c6120f69","upvotes":60,"downvotes":12,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Cold","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_C_jl.jpg","score":0.83361254225622,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-6645813d-6dd8-3e68-bd2d-5dc1d23ae32f_a-2873717a-19bd-312b-9f5b-e7c3c6120f69","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-6645813d-6dd8-3e68-bd2d-5dc1d23ae32f_a-2873717a-19bd-312b-9f5b-e7c3c6120f69","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"The Independent","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/turkey-apos-erdogan-refuses-recognise-145600874.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_635\/b840d66754f0b03173b3ddb6a373cbdd","title":"Turkey's Erdogan refuses to recognise US ambassador as visa spat escalates","summary":"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that he does not recognise the US ambassador to the country as a representative of the US government, adding that Washington should recall the diplomat if he does not reverse a decision to partially suspend visa services between the two countries.

The agony of defeat goes both ways: I watched in 1989 as a small nation of just over 1 million adorned themselves in Red White and Black national colors to fill the stadium in these colors as a single goal from the US men's team denied that small nation the first chance to go to the world cup.  It was the agony of defeat and I watched a million Trini's (as they refer to themselves) weep openly in disbelief.\n\nFor Trinidad this is payback as the US as beaten them every time since 1989 in world cup qualifier.  I say this because beating the US men's team yesterday did NOTHING for the Trinidad that has performed the worst in their group and is LAST in the standing.
