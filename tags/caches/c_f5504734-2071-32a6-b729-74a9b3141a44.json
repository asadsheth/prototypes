Hours after Ankara announced officials would meet soon to settle differences, Erdogan accused the U.S. consulate in Istanbul of hiding an individual with links to a network he blames for last year's failed coup. Turkey's relations with the United States and many Western countries have been strained since last year's failed military coup against Erdogan, in which more than 240 people were killed.","published_at":1507787238,"content_id":"be11f298-59b2-3a8a-a891-67fc226ead5c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/turkish-u-officials-decide-meet-resolve-dispute-deputy-074037837.html","content_published_at":1507817213,"content_relative_time":32,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44"},"created_at":1507866963,"comment_relative_time":19,"bot":false},{"text":"Historical parallels never pan out.","message_id":"cefdef21-683c-427e-b2a1-5ad9a38743ce","context_id":"b713caea-7a50-306e-b448-b5e8f32557d4","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Geoff","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_G_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"AXX2HLY6PAB6Y27XJHTOZRCVZU","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-5781d915-db1f-3a35-b7f0-7e32f0b024ee_a-b713caea-7a50-306e-b448-b5e8f32557d4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/donald-trump-kaiser-wilhelm-parallels-5fnefu2","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Foreign Policy Magazine","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/donald-trump-kaiser-wilhelm-parallels-130020474.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/foreign_policy_magazine\/c51f90c841a1c35babb3b78bd7e24697","title":"The Donald Trump-Kaiser Wilhelm Parallels Are Getting Scary","summary":"Both men were insecure and undisciplined \u2014 and in charge of governments in thrall to the military.","published_at":1507813278,"content_id":"b713caea-7a50-306e-b448-b5e8f32557d4","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/donald-trump-kaiser-wilhelm-parallels-130020474.html","content_published_at":1507813220,"content_relative_time":34,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44"},"created_at":1507899689,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":false},{"text":"The 1% - Screwing Over 3 Countries for Their Greed","message_id":"aebe290f-09ce-4e05-931c-5522b8dde0f8","context_id":"019ac171-9190-312e-84cc-f53a6d17d412","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Jim Bob","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"HOQWKEAPXEHLSDTXMRAJ5A7QXY","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-fe9a60f5-e412-3cc8-9eb0-f0bb8e8d330d_a-019ac171-9190-312e-84cc-f53a6d17d412","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-fe9a60f5-e412-3cc8-9eb0-f0bb8e8d330d_a-019ac171-9190-312e-84cc-f53a6d17d412","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Bloomberg Video","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/nafta-negotiations-canada-u-mexico-122919254.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/bloomberg_932\/e9364d7c192462125520b29650095076","title":"Nafta Negotiations: What Canada, U.S., Mexico Need","summary":null,"published_at":1507856717,"content_id":"019ac171-9190-312e-84cc-f53a6d17d412","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/nafta-negotiations-canada-u-mexico-122919254.html","content_published_at":1507811359,"content_relative_time":34,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44"},"created_at":1507873182,"comment_relative_time":17,"bot":false},{"text":"Obama","message_id":"c32be3e6-9962-43e1-bb50-ebbd4b38a370","context_id":"ecc0ab01-61c4-3188-b37f-63b663a3c545","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Brian","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_jl_2.jpg","author_guid":"D5O3RYYUITVQQQHC3L75TPGTDM","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-28e25016-dac9-397c-9468-e43af86524c3_a-ecc0ab01-61c4-3188-b37f-63b663a3c545","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/u-lost-war-syria-russia-18u1s03","author":"third_watch","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/u-lost-war-syria-russia-152502711.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/ce2041e7124f41491626d8f8ee51574f","title":"How the U.S. Lost the War in Syria to Russia and Iran","summary":"When\u00a0the U.S. and its allies\u00a0finally began their offensive to defeat the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) in the eastern Syrian province of Deir Ezzor in August 2017, the Syrian battlefield looked very different to when the conflict began in 2011.

Hours after Ankara announced officials would meet soon to settle differences, Erdogan accused the U.S. consulate in Istanbul of hiding an individual with links to a network he blames for last year's failed coup. Turkey's relations with the United States and many Western countries have been strained since last year's failed military coup against Erdogan, in which more than 240 people were killed.","published_at":1507787238,"content_id":"be11f298-59b2-3a8a-a891-67fc226ead5c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/turkish-u-officials-decide-meet-resolve-dispute-deputy-074037837.html","content_published_at":1507817213,"content_relative_time":32,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44"},"created_at":1507829181,"comment_relative_time":29,"bot":false},{"text":"i think Turkey needs new elections !!","message_id":"56d1d0c4-7458-4159-8cfc-b7cddeb9d26c","context_id":"7e5257aa-b886-30da-8b60-1f4339f5c56a","upvotes":1,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"heritagesoftailclassic","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_H_ald.jpg","author_guid":"VWBF5DYEKATPROBZA7ICJXO3NU","score":0.37768959125474,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-7340bb00-199c-3371-84d8-c17ba933899b_a-7e5257aa-b886-30da-8b60-1f4339f5c56a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-7340bb00-199c-3371-84d8-c17ba933899b_a-7e5257aa-b886-30da-8b60-1f4339f5c56a","author":"nanook","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/u-still-seeking-explanation-arrest-staff-turkey-ambassador-101943522.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2017-10-11T154457Z_2_LYNXMPED9A1CU_RTROPTP_2_USA-TURKEY-SECURITY.JPG","title":"U.S. still seeking explanation for arrest of staff in Turkey: ambassador","summary":"By Tulay Karadeniz and Gulsen Solaker ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States is still seeking an explanation from Ankara for the detention of staff at U.S. missions in Turkey which led Washington to stop issuing visas and triggered a diplomatic crisis, the U.S. ambassador said on Wednesday.
