In other countries, kids grow up playing and practicing soccer daily. And these are just the ones playing for fun. Then those countries pick the best of them and invest (yes, their club teams pay, not the parents) in training these better kids into elite players.\n\nWe have none of that. In the US, the parents invest and the club \/ travel teams take money and play the kids that can afford it, and most of the times, these parents also sideline coach their kids or push them the way they think is best. How can these kids compare to youths in countries that develop their skills around 6 hrs a day everyday?\n\nAgain, I emphasize, these club \/ travel teams are all about winning so they can charge the parents higher fees, so their main focus is to win. And that makes it similarly to the high school and college systems, both are BAD, they push the players to play 100% like it's the NFL divisional game or NBA\/NHL playoffs, players have to run until they can't anymore to win high school and college games. It's ridiculous.\nSo after each game, players take A LOT of time just to recover, that means time lost in training, and many get injured needlessly that takes even more time off from training\/developing, and they can never train properly to be as good as they could.\n\nSo our high school system, college, clubs, and travel teams, are just terrible in developing players. Adding to this is the cost, and mainly middle class families participate, we're lucky we even have Pulisic. But one is not enough, we need to have 23 good skilled players.

Watch the replays, if you can stomach them. It\u2019s technically true. Clint Dempsey hit the right post with a long-range bouncer in the second half down in Trinidad. If his shot goes in, the USA almost certainly escapes with a 2-2 draw and is on its way to the World Cup. The margins on Omar Gonzalez\u2019s early own goal were even finer. The beleaguered center back couldn\u2019t hit that slice again if given 100 chances.And then there was the phantom goal scored by Panama in Tuesday's 2-1 defeat of Costa Rica. Had the Guatemalan officials realized the ball never crossed the line, the USA at least would be on its way to a playoff against Australia\u2014a few thousand miles in the opposite direction but still, mere inches away.Inches can influence results and in turn, shape narratives. That\u2019s certainly the case in a given game or even in a short tournament like a World Cup. And for that reason, soccer\u2019s quadrennial global party isn\u2019t the best litmus test for an individual country\u2019s progress. For most participants, the whole thing lasts a couple weeks. The draw, injuries, referees and bounces all play a massive role.But qualifying isn\u2019t a short tournament. It\u2019s a two-year, 16-game grind\u2014about half a league season\u2014that asks questions, tests depth and resilience and exposes flaws, both personal and systemic. And after a bumbling 7-5-4 campaign that featured a coaching change and an historically inept three-win performance in CONCACAF\u2019s Hexagonal, both the current U.S. national team and the U.S. Soccer Federation were exposed.It\u2019s tempting to dig deep, down to the foundation, and advocate for a total overhaul in structure, governance, philosophy and personnel. Conversations certainly must be had about all of those things and at this point, it\u2019s hard to argue against change\u2014especially at the top. And there\u2019s time to have those conversations, since the American men won\u2019t play another meaningful game for nearly two years.But if you want to torch the system and scorch the earth, understand first that U.S. Soccer\u2019s\/soccer\u2019s idiosyncrasies didn\u2019t stop it from playing in the previous seven World Cups (one of which it hosted.) It\u2019s important to isolate variables. Our system has many flaws, but it took a little bit extra to achieve what the USA managed over the past year-plus. Missing out on the 2018 World Cup was about the failure of individual men to do what a quarter century of forebears found a way to achieve. It was about poor leadership, poor planning, poor play and, yes, a few inches here or there.How many times over the past few months did we hear a U.S. player invoke his team\u2019s traditional reply when \u201cbacks were against the wall?\u201d Indeed, there was an established national team tradition of responding to adversity.Perhaps American backs are often against walls because of those aforementioned flaws in the system. But it\u2019s also true that those do-or-die days usually brought out the best in the U.S. player. There was always enough in the tank and heart. But that attribute isn\u2019t immutable. It doesn\u2019t exist or persist simply because they say it does. It\u2019s a fire that must be stoked\u2014a culture that must be nurtured through commitment and vigilance. For some reason, this group of players folded when their backs were up against it. And on Tuesday, in the game of their lives, they were listless and inept. Meanwhile, their manager went against what had been working, ignored the obvious and made an indefensible tactical blunder. This was a choke job of historic proportions that put paid to the idea that the USA inevitably rises to the occasion. This is a team that was congratulating itself for predecessors\u2019 accomplishments.So this failure could be measured in inches and moments, but also with a wide-angle lens and a calendar. It\u2019s a failure of men as much as an indictment of any system (it\u2019s worth noting that playing in MLS didn\u2019t seem to adversely impact the men from Costa Rica, Panama and Honduras who remain in World Cup contention). These Americans stumbled where others had succeeded. And before U.S. Soccer moves forward and decides who will be along for the ride, it must determine where responsibility lies.The USA\u2019s five qualifying defeats were the most in a given cycle in program history. From 1980 through 2015, it lost two home qualifiers. Then it lost home games to Mexico (under Jurgen Klinsmann) and Costa Rica (under Bruce Arena) 10 months apart. The Americans finished first in the Hex in 2006, 2010 and 2014. This time they finished fifth, five points behind their previous low (17).Why was this team so much worse?A couple answers come to mind, and it starts with USSF president Sunil Gulati and his handpicked coaches, Klinsmann and Arena. All bear massive responsibility. Gulati was seduced by Klinsmann\u2019s charisma and his promise of cachet and cultural change, and he realized far too late that the German\u2019s big ideas\u2014many of which were good\u2014didn\u2019t make him a decent manager on gameday. A good chunk of the USA\u2019s identity\u2014that backs against the wall spirit and cohesion\u2014was stripped away by Klinsmann\u2019s inability to establish a tactical foundation, his predilection for discomfort and division, his poor preparation and so many inscrutable decisions.Klinsmann belonged in an office, boardroom or classroom, not on the sideline. But Gulati\u2019s delay and misplaced faith meant the potential benefit of the former had to be sacrificed.Gulati burdened himself and U.S. Soccer with Klinsmann\u2019s unearned promotion and contract extension ahead of the 2014 World Cup, then waited too long to fire him once it was clear in late 2015 that the team was lost. He had no choice after Klinsmann wrecked the Hex opener against Mexico with an impromptu 3-5-2 and the subsequent 4-0 demolition in Costa Rica, during which the USA clearly quit on its coach. But significant damage had been done.The record wasn\u2019t the biggest problem\u2014six points can be overcome in the Hex. The lack of time to find the right successor and recondition the team was the issue. Had Klinsmann left a year earlier, more could\u2019ve been done to overhaul the squad. But because the USA was 0-2-0 and in desperate need of an immediate turnaround, the decision to appoint Arena\u2014and the legendary coach\u2019s pragmatism and reliance on veterans for a quick fix\u2014was defensible.No progress had been made toward identifying and grooming goalkeeper Tim Howard\u2019s successor. If it wasn\u2019t going to be Brad Guzan, Klinsmann could\u2019ve decided that in early 2015 and started to commit to new candidates. Howard aged before our eyes over the past couple months. The defense continued to be an area of excessive flux, to the point where Arena\u2019s reserve options at left and right back were the 35-year-old DaMarcus Beasley and converted attacking midfielder Graham Zusi, respectively. The same is true in the middle, where younger prospects like Matt Miazga, Matt Hedges, Cameron Carter-Vickers and others remained on the outside looking in for too long. When the stakes were highest, Arena understandably felt uncomfortable thrusting a newbie into the qualifying cauldron. But they shouldn't have been newbies by then. Injuries to the likes of DeAndre Yedlin and John Brooks hurt, and fullbacks like Eric Lichaj, Greg Garza, Justin Morrow and Timmy Chandler simply were ignored to one extent or another.The coaching change paid some immediate dividends. U.S. players lauded the breath of fresh air and appreciated Arena\u2019s logic, planning and communication. Arena infused a bit of confidence and comfort and then added to that foundation. He\u2019s been praised for his ability to maximize potential and chemistry and for a keen understanding of strengths and weaknesses in a given individual or group. In March, Dempsey and Christian Pulisic unloaded on hapless Honduras in a 6-0 rout. In June, we saw what appeared to be a coaching masterclass as Arena meticulously prepared for two very different games just three days apart. After easing past T&T in Denver, he deployed a group that had trained in the 3-5-2 and was able to secure a 1-1 tie in Mexico. The USA was on its way.With the Gold Cup title secured in July, the momentum was palpable. Veterans like Dempsey, Howard, Jozy Altidore and Michael Bradley were energized and Paul Arriola emerged as a new option out wide. The margin for error remained small\u2014this wasn\u2019t the time to experiment with uncapped kids\u2014but Russia was closer than ever. Gulati could probably see it from U.S. Soccer House.Then the wheels fell off. One thing Arena seems to have in common with Klinsmann is arrogance\u2013a belief in his own infallibility and the notion that if something occurs to him and seems like a good idea, it therefore must be one. It was clear midway through the first half in the September qualifier against Costa Rica at Red Bull Arena that Arena's 4-4-2 wasn\u2019t working. The USA couldn\u2019t handle the Ticos\u2019 pressure, couldn\u2019t establish any rhythm with the ball and couldn\u2019t find Pulisic on the right wing.When Klinsmann set the USA up to fail against Mexico, it took pleading from his players to force an in-game change. That didn\u2019t appear to happen at RBA, and Costa Rica ran out 2-0 winners.Arena said following the match that he\u2019d been outcoached. But that\u2019s impossible, right?\u201cI do that so you guys don\u2019t have to try to be creative and actually try to figure out what happened in the game,\u201d Arena told reporters a couple days later in Honduras. \u201cTo be honest with you, I didn\u2019t really necessarily mean that. I just said that so you don\u2019t have to spend any time critiquing anyone else.\u201dThe players didn\u2019t make plays that night at RBA. Howard and Geoff Cameron were the scapegoats in back, and the U.S. lamented the referee\u2019s failure to intervene on its behalf on a couple close calls. But the USA was set up to fail.Like Klinsmann, Arena demanded too much from Bradley. The captain is a good player and should have a future with the national team, but somehow two consecutive coaches decided he\u2019s superhuman. Klinsmann tasked Bradley with orchestrating the build-up, monitoring Jermaine Jones and playing as a No. 10\u2014often simultaneously. Arena emptied the U.S. midfield and asked Bradley to link the back four to the attackers essentially on his own. If Bradley was that good, he\u2019d have left Roma for Juventus, not Toronto FC. He needed to start, but he needed help. But Arena stopped calling in Benny Feilhaber and Sacha Kljestan, didn\u2019t develop Kellyn Acosta or Cristian Roldan, didn\u2019t use Alejandro Bedoya or Dax McCarty and thought too highly of the reticent Darlington Nagbe. The 3-5-2 that worked against Mexico was essentially abandoned. A 4-2-3-1, which would\u2019ve allowed Pulisic to stay central while offering a bit of support to Bradley, apparently wasn\u2019t considered.Moving Pulisic to the middle and last week\u2019s 4-0 win over Panama in Orlando masked the formational and foundational deficiencies. Success required everyone to have an on-day against a passive opponent. Inexplicably, Arena failed to realize the frailties of that 4-4-2 and sent the same players out against Trinidad just four days later, despite having used fresher, more prepared charges in previous away games. Dempsey, Cameron and Guzan were on the bench. Everyone had off-days, and once again, Arena took too long to accept the inevitable and make needed changes.He left the USA\u2019s fate tied to those inches.","published_at":1507755634,"content_id":"94156f6b-4db5-301a-be45-14674235553b","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/arrogance-poor-play-fine-margins-193816451.html","content_published_at":1507750696,"content_relative_time":20,"vibe_name":"United States"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":20,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-10a31fed-0a25-3d1b-9647-d8207f3040e5_a-1ab0a865-1ac7-3ec3-bc6d-976ef0e6b880","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/un-investigators-visit-syria-air-gas-attack-probe-1hdscap","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"AFP","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/un-investigators-visit-syria-air-gas-attack-probe-225156089.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/1cc0436cac9850f9f6d299b70670095435250388.jpg","title":"UN investigators to visit Syria air base in gas attack probe","summary":"UN investigators will this week travel to an air base in Syria that the United States and its allies say was used to launch the sarin gas attack on Khan Sheikhun, diplomats told AFP on Wednesday.

The U.S. effectively needs only a win or a tie against last-place Trinidad and Tobago to punch a ticket for Russia. But the soccer gods make sure that little comes easy in CONCACAF, and this time that means a playing surface waterlogged by the recent downpours of the Caribbean rainy season.The Trinis moved Tuesday\u2019s game (as they\u2019re allowed to) from the national stadium to Ato Boldon Stadium, a smaller structure an hour south of the capital, due to what are said to be electrical problems in the usual venue. And when the U.S. players arrived for training on Monday, they were greeted by a moat of standing water that required players to be taken on piggyback by staffers onto the field.\u201cIt was more comedic than anything,\u201d U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard said.The corners and sides of the field were under water as well. But as of Monday afternoon, U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati said the game was still on track for the planned kickoff at 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday (BeIN Sports, Universo).\u201cRight now the field is draining very well,\u201d he said. \u201cOur guys have just come from the match commissioner\u2019s meeting. The game is on for 8, and if after inspecting the field tomorrow morning the field conditions are not playable, then a decision will be made. But at this point, it\u2019s absolutely playable.\u201dAmusingly, a few political feathers were ruffled during the day on Monday. U.S. Soccer posted video of the piggybacking scenes on social media, and the Trinidad and Tobago federation issued a statement criticizing U.S. Soccer for it. In its release, the TTFA included a photograph of the famous SnowCl\u00e1sico game, in which the U.S. beat Costa Rica in a 2013 World Cup qualifier played in a Colorado blizzard.The conditions aren\u2019t ideal, of course, but U.S. coach Bruce Arena noted that both teams will have to play on the same field.\u201cIt definitely changes the way the game is going to look,\u201d Arena said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a slow game, probably a little bit sloppy, a little bit different than we\u2019ve seen in any of the qualifying games. We\u2019ll have to adapt to the conditions on the field.\u201dCONCACAF qualifying is a special breed of soccer, to say the least.\u201cI would love to see one of these hotshot teams from Europe come here and play in our CONCACAF qualifying and really get a taste of this and see what that\u2019s about,\u201d Arena cracked. \u201cThis is very challenging. This is like survival of the fittest. They could do one of those TV shows on this. ' Who will survive in the end?' That\u2019s basically what this is.\u201dThe chances of the U.S.\u2019s survival to reach Russia are certainly higher after Friday\u2019s pressure-easing 4-0 victory against Panama. All three CONCACAF finales will kick off at the same time on Tuesday. U.S. captain Michael Bradley said the team would be well-aware of the scores in the other games, but he added that the U.S. has the benefit of controlling its own destiny. Win\u2014or even tie, as long as Panama or Honduras don\u2019t erase huge goal-difference gaps\u2014and the U.S. is in. Nor would a loss completely eliminate the U.S., unless both Panama and Honduras were also to win.Tuesday\u2019s game will be a little surreal: Played in front of few home fans on a drenched field, it nevertheless is of giant importance for the United States. It isn\u2019t a final, obviously, but the culmination of a long and grueling process makes it feel like one.\u201cIt feels like a very big game,\u201d said Bradley. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to navigate so much \u2026 There\u2019s been good moments, there\u2019s been bad moments, there\u2019s been moments where our backs were up against the wall. There were moments when people probably thought we weren\u2019t qualifying. And in a real strong way, we were able to pull our group tight and make sure that none of the stuff on the outside threw us off. The reward is tomorrow night. That after 15 games we get our chance to play 90 minutes with the World Cup on the line.\u201dRight back DeAndre Yedlin, who had a terrific return to the U.S. lineup on Friday, said his psychology for this game was no different than the one he had for the Panama game.\u201cI\u2019m trying to go in with the same mentality I had last Friday: That we needed to win,\u201d Yedlin said. \u201cYou have to look at the situation of the game and how things are going. You know that a draw will probably do, but you never want to settle for that. If we\u2019re not going for the win, then we shouldn\u2019t even be on the field.\u201dOne of the question marks for Tuesday is the status of midfielder Christian Pulisic, the U.S.\u2019s biggest offensive threat, who came off midway through the second half on Friday after being targeted by the Panamanian defense. Pulisic was limping after the game, but he sounded optimistic on Monday.\u201cIt\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s improving every single day. I\u2019m just trying to get as much recovery now as I can \u2026 I got kicked in the calf at the end of the Panama game. But it felt good today, so we\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on for tomorrow.\u201dCONCACAF referees certainly haven\u2019t protected Pulisic by issuing many yellow cards, and the confederation\u2019s yellow-card suspension rules\u2014which apply to two yellow cards in any of the 15 games going back to November 2015\u2014mean Pulisic\u2019s U.S. teammates have been unwilling to exact retribution (though if Jermaine Jones were around he might have decapitated someone by now).\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem with our sport,\u201d Howard said on Monday. \u201cI wish we could [retaliate]. I\u2019m envious of hockey players and baseball players. But you can\u2019t. There isn\u2019t anything we could do. I wish we could because we\u2019d lay it all on the line to protect him. You try your best to do what you can. But the onus is on the individual player in soccer to have enough wherewithal about him, both mentally and physically, and not fly off the handle and ride tackles and play the game. He\u2019s done a good job with that.\u201dFor his part, Pulisic said he\u2019d been targeted since his youth soccer days with his parents on the sidelines.\u201cMy mom would be the one to kind of yell,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad would just be like, \u2018Get up!\u2019 It was a good balance, I guess.\u201dAs Pulisic sat on the bench after coming off Friday, he displayed a relatively new tattoo on the upper part of his left arm, something that caught the eye of plenty of TV viewers. The tattoo is of a giant bald eagle in front of a giant American flag.\u201cThere\u2019s not much of a story,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cObviously, people saw it for the first time, I guess. I like tattoos.
