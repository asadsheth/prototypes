Her premiums were $187\/month. I had insurance through my company, big company, not one of those union packages but still very good health insurance. Her co-pays on medication and Dr visits were lower than mine. There was no co-insurance, no deductible, no cap on coverage. Her policy was called sub-standard by obama. The media wanted you to think that these sub standard policies were those fake discount cards you buy but that was a lie. What made her coverage \"sub-standard\" according to obama was that she opted out of maternity coverage. She had no plans to get pregnant. They can prevent that nowadays ya know. So when obamacare came into being, you could not find her policy, which was VERY affordable. My friends who retired early thinking they could get \"affordable\" insurance under obamacare, were forced, very quickly, into going back to work for insurance. Unless you qualified for medicaid\/welfare, NOTHING about obamacare was affordable. A year after obamacare went into existence, my insurance at my company, premiums went up as did deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance. In addition to my higher premiums I was paying $10,000 in additional out of pocket expenses.","message_id":"fa877aa5-6c6d-4671-bf72-895f8638ebfb","context_id":"ca83746a-26ca-3593-9d06-f6e69bc6af72","upvotes":515,"downvotes":237,"reports":1,"replies":121,"author_name":"ray","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_jd_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"Q2WICDAIOEG3E5SKYMGLK6AJHA","score":0.69279508326811,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-439f35c8-8793-37a8-9b98-0e87be65a68a_a-ca83746a-26ca-3593-9d06-f6e69bc6af72","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/politics\/leading-senators-outline-health-insurance-5dl81j7","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/leading-senators-outline-health-insurance-155159011.html","img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/slick-72618-1508268007533.jpg","title":"A short-term health deal by senators _ with Trump's blessing","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican and Democratic senators joined in announcing a plan Tuesday aimed at stabilizing America's health insurance markets in the wake of President Donald Trump's order to terminate \"Obamacare\" subsidies.
