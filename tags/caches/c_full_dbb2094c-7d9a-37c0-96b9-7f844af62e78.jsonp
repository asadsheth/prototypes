Faster than any other company, so actually getting the power restored faster than a company that would have to move equipment and people there after a lengthy bid process.  And finally, there is special equipment needed to reach the heights of the towers they are rebuilding, and Whitefish has it.  So another way of doing it faster. \n\nI have personally done several commercial construction projects in Puerto Rico. It takes weeks to get goods there.
