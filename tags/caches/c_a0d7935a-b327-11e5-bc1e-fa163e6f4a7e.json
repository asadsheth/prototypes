Unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the 2010 law in a Congress led by his own party, Trump indicated he would take unilateral action. It would also expand the amount of time people can use short-term medical insurance plans, which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits.","published_at":1507650867,"content_id":"9909b77b-acc5-388f-b0d7-9d42edf6f58c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-says-likely-sign-healthcare-order-week-163535849.html","content_published_at":1507661905,"content_relative_time":23,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform"},"created_at":1507663114,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":false},{"text":"because the rich need to get richer and the citizens and what they want doesn't matter to trump.","id":"b72be4c3-4f9b-4a8f-92d2-519a5727b84c","context_id":"d33263cf-4abe-37a0-88e2-23402c532096","upvotes":50,"downvotes":5,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"tobsure","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/bbcdf64bd731308cfa4c5099f36afe0d_192.jpeg","score":0.88592875588914,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-77146b05-c9db-33d2-b774-5e0812c342ec_a-d33263cf-4abe-37a0-88e2-23402c532096","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/donald-trump-reveals-plan-executive-5psgxit","author":"nanook","provider":"The Independent","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/donald-trump-reveals-plan-executive-114500058.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_independent_635\/979ce583a21865badd9144b16b1369da","title":"Donald Trump reveals plan for executive order to bypass Congress and gut Obamacare","summary":"Donald Trump has confirmed he plans to use an executive order to undermine some of the key elements of Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.
