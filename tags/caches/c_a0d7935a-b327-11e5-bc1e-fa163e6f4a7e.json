The ACA was working just fine for me. I could count on the fact that it had all the basic coverage in place, with no hidden exceptions, and with no huge costs for being old (yeah, me) or sick (not really). I paid a reasonable amount for my insurance (no subsidies - I make enough to take care of my own needs).\n\nNow, all of that is history because of Republican actions. Every insurance contract can be written (as they were pre-2013) to include a multitude of exceptions. Unless you read every line (yeah, I do), you'll find out about the exceptions when your daughter gets leukemia.\n\nAnd, yeah, if you're 27 you possibly don't care if old folks pay 5x or more so that you can get cheap insurance. But you'll be old one day too. The ACA tried for a middle ground (3x for old folks) to spread the load. You pay a little more up front, you pay a little less when older (and more vulnerable to costs). Now all the rules are off.\n\nYou think that everything will work out fine - but no, it won't. These actions will break the individual health care market. The chaos that will ensue will cause irreparable damage to people - your sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, and parents - and will make receiving real health care a function of how wealthy you are.

I was a tool maker, an engineer, and a quality manager during my career. My whole life I made a little better than average wages, was in the 3rd quintile of income. Without the ACA I would have been bankrupt, either from medical bills or from trying to pay upwards of $2000\/month for health insurance premiums, along with a deductible of $5,000 or $6,000, and no maximum on out of pocket expenses. I would have been forced to pay whatever the insurance company offered at the end of COBRA coverage, because there would have been no other option due to pre-existing conditions. I know that because I was in that position when I ws running my own business in 2001.\n\nI was on Obamacare insurance for 2 1\/2 years, am now on Medicare. The insurance I had under Obamacare actually was better than my former employer had offered. When my wife had surgery last year for a condition that was leaving her completely incapacitated, I paid $4500 of a bill that approached $150,000. Under the plan my employer had, the bill would have been closer to $20,000. \n\nObamacare has its faults, but it also offers help to millions of people like me, who worked hard their whole lives but who developed health issues later in life. Thank God that some people decided to do something to help the working man, and may those who are destroying that help realize what they are doing.","message_id":"ab115501-8a82-4e1d-908c-59415699b2e7","context_id":"5e579ffe-43b2-3707-ac4a-dd95b5542bc9","upvotes":265,"downvotes":31,"reports":0,"replies":25,"author_name":"JohnnyB","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"SRNHLV4TPRXOSHPAYYE7WJDQUI","score":0.902327759205,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-2ccd6d33-1f71-3ce6-b235-43600f9495ee_a-5e579ffe-43b2-3707-ac4a-dd95b5542bc9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/trump-administration-end-obamacare-subsidies-known-cost-sharing-034004960--abc-news-topstories-2urzs76","author":"third_watch","provider":"Good Morning America","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/trump-administration-end-obamacare-subsidies-known-cost-sharing-034004960--abc-news-topstories.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.abcnewsplus.com\/c6681a66e43aa115594f2f8489b85888","title":"Trump to end Obamacare subsidies that help low-income Americans","summary":"The White House announced Thursday night that the administration will slash Obamacare subsidy payments to insurers.

The health systems in the local markets are in control of the costs of healthcare and that includes the cost to insurance companies.

It just won't happen.  I have done this in the in my market many times. I have even done it with a nationwide large insurer who want to try and bring cut rate benefit products into the market.  Just would not contract with that insurer for those products.  The insurer never got them into the market.   That is the market and how it works and nothing that Trump singed will impact that market.  That is without any of the law suits that will occur for violating the ACA the actual law of the land by states, insurers, providers, etc.  None of this fixes the rising costs in the market place.  Even the congressional proposal that fail would not have change the increases in prices, because none of them address the real drivers in the market place - the local healthcare systems, which are virtual local monopolies.  Instead they go after the insurance companies who are middlemen in the healthcare system.  What do you think makes up 85% of the costs of every health insurance company?  It is what they have to pay to doctors, hospital, and yes, those local monopolistic health systems.  And there are not controls on those cost drivers and nothing in any of the legislative proposals.

A report from the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) reveals that the fiscal pain coming to states may be even worse than anticipated.  In Ohio, Medicaid expansion ran $1.5 billion over budget in its first 18 months.  The state of Washington had to increase its biennium budget by $2.3 billion to deal with higher than expected Medicaid expansion costs and, having now surpassed even those revised projections, expansion overruns continue to climb.  Illinois\u2019 Medicaid expansion ran $800 million over budget in 2014 and has now signed up more able-bodied adults than state officials predicted would ever be eligible.

All those healthy people will jump on the cheap plans that cover very little and think nothing more of it. Then when something major happens their cheap plan won't cover it and they'll find themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt that they can't pay back. And we'll be right back to skyrocketing premiums and skyrocketing health care costs. Changing insurance rules isn't going to help anyone. We need to address the cost of health care. We shouldn't need insurance to have simple procedures done because they're so insanely expensive. Insurance should be for major problems (heart attack, cancer, emergency surgery, etc). If we're going to reduce what insurance has to cover on these cheaper plans we'll likely be cutting out the major things insurance should actually be used for. So everyone will be happy in the short term and die with insane amounts of debt that won't be repaid and hospitals will get the shaft and raise their prices even more.","message_id":"a0189ca7-561d-46fd-bfdd-3b3238e00c1a","context_id":"d140e602-e653-3c94-8d3b-323d80e74e26","upvotes":121,"downvotes":48,"reports":0,"replies":67,"author_name":"ryanm","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/5e969ef882d95ce933b8c442f24b4a3a_192.jpeg","author_guid":"OFC5RXWAU2HGFXNINHUTTKAQBA","score":0.7381170324034,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-e4ac907f-7966-322c-aeaf-b621cc3e8162_a-d140e602-e653-3c94-8d3b-323d80e74e26","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-e4ac907f-7966-322c-aeaf-b621cc3e8162_a-d140e602-e653-3c94-8d3b-323d80e74e26","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-plans-sign-order-undermine-023825246.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_huffington_post_584\/7ace561d4c9267c98ea63f2e74a5eb75","title":"Trump Signs Order To Undermine Obamacare Insurance Rules","summary":"President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an order that could rattle\u00a0the Affordable Care Act\u2019s private insurance markets by allowing a proliferation of cheaper, less comprehensive plans that would undermine rules about who and what insurers must cover.","published_at":1507812999,"content_id":"d140e602-e653-3c94-8d3b-323d80e74e26","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-plans-sign-order-undermine-023825246.html","content_published_at":1507775905,"content_relative_time":44,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e"},"created_at":1507808013,"comment_relative_time":35,"bot":false},{"text":"\"When President Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, they probably weren\u2019t aware they placed a booby trap in the law.\"  Of course they weren't aware.
