Ron Johnson suggests compromise on health care","summary":"Washington (CNN)Republican Sen. Ron Johnson said Sunday he believed Congress could reach an agreement on health care that includes continuing the funding of a key set of Obamacare subsidies to keep down insurance premiums. The conservative Wisconsin senator said in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that he understands some of his Republican colleagues are against funding the cost-sharing reduction -- or CSR -- payments. But he said the government should keep making the payments to prevent the cost of insurance skyrocketing. President Trump has not committed to paying insurers the cost-sharing subsidies, which reduce deductibles and co-pays for low-income Obamacare enrollees.

President Donald Trump has long asserted that selling insurance across state lines would trigger competition that brings down premiums for people buying their own policies. Experts say that's not guaranteed, partly because health insurance reflects local medical costs, which vary widely around the country. Trump was expected to sign the executive order next week, likely on Thursday, a senior administration official said Sunday.","published_at":1507514250,"content_id":"b6372753-5b4b-3b25-9a47-42aa5bf8103b","content_url":"http:\/\/www.philly.com\/philly\/news\/politics\/presidential\/20171008_ap_2ba17a44fa114101a5ce5922fd1eb61e.html","content_published_at":1507483440,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-f2ddbe90-6fd9-3a11-85a6-d9fa4a1d1aec_a-dba91df4-6b10-3086-a235-c040cda8dec9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/china-allow-drugs-based-foreign-48zgpiz","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"CTVNews","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/mobile\/health\/china-to-allow-some-drugs-based-on-foreign-approvals-1.3624756","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KRh0ENimOw_nWN..B1F3rg--\/dz02MjA7aD0zNDk7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_dba91df4-6b10-3086-a235-c040cda8dec9-1870790331.jpeg","title":"China to allow some drugs based on foreign approvals","summary":"BEIJING -- China will allow use of some drugs and medical devices based on approval by foreign regulators, the government said Monday, in a move that could help to ease access to its health care market.
