Just an hour later, Suns head coach Earl Watson was fired.According to ABC15 Sports, Bledsoe told Suns GM Ryan McDonough the tweet was in reference to him being at a hair salon, rather than in reference to playing for the Suns. McDonough said he \"didn't believe that to be true\" and that \"he won't be with us going forward.\" ESPN's Chris Haynes added more fuel to the fire, reporting Bledsoe met with the team before shootaround Monday morning, was sent home and will not play in Monday night's game against the Sacramento Kings.Wojnarowski reports interest in Bledsoe around the NBA increased once his desire to leave became clear. Bledsoe, 27, was the No. 18 pick in the 2010 NBA draft and has played for the Suns since 2013. Last season, the former Kentucky guard averaged a career-best 21.1 points and 6.3 assists per game. In three games this season, Bledsoe is averaging 15.7 points and three assists per game.Phoenix has lost its first three games of the season by an average margin of 30.67 points, including a 124-76 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on opening-night, the biggest loss in franchise history.","published_at":1508820750,"content_id":"2acdd0b0-e245-3009-a2f4-fb8f2c120504","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/report-suns-discussing-eric-bledsoe-174137492.html","content_published_at":1508780497,"content_relative_time":50,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508951857,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":false},{"text":"One of the biggest bust ever.

Just an hour later, Suns head coach Earl Watson was fired.According to ABC15 Sports, Bledsoe told Suns GM Ryan McDonough the tweet was in reference to him being at a hair salon, rather than in reference to playing for the Suns. McDonough said he \"didn't believe that to be true\" and that \"he won't be with us going forward.\" ESPN's Chris Haynes added more fuel to the fire, reporting Bledsoe met with the team before shootaround Monday morning, was sent home and will not play in Monday night's game against the Sacramento Kings.Wojnarowski reports interest in Bledsoe around the NBA increased once his desire to leave became clear. Bledsoe, 27, was the No. 18 pick in the 2010 NBA draft and has played for the Suns since 2013. Last season, the former Kentucky guard averaged a career-best 21.1 points and 6.3 assists per game. In three games this season, Bledsoe is averaging 15.7 points and three assists per game.Phoenix has lost its first three games of the season by an average margin of 30.67 points, including a 124-76 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on opening-night, the biggest loss in franchise history.","published_at":1508820750,"content_id":"2acdd0b0-e245-3009-a2f4-fb8f2c120504","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/report-suns-discussing-eric-bledsoe-174137492.html","content_published_at":1508780497,"content_relative_time":50,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508866968,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":false},{"text":"LOLOL....like it matters.

James said the onus was on the Mavericks to defend Bell on the play and downplayed the significance of Bell's alley-oop, per Cleveland.com's Chris Fedor: In a move generally reserved for the All-Star Game, Bell threw the ball off the backboard to himself and completed a two-handed dunk with a little under three minutes left in the game.

He kept up his hot shooting during Tuesday's game against the Orlando Magic, knocking down his first four 3-pointers, but it was his passing that drew the most attention. In the first half, Russell bounced a pocket pass between the legs of Magic center Nikola Vucevic to hit a rolling Jarrett Allen, who (unfortunately) was unable to complete the dunk. And in the second half, just to prove it wasn't an accident, Russell did it to Vucevic again.

That was after James moved to point guard\u00a0because of\u00a0injuries to Cavs point guards Isaiah Thomas and Derrick Rose. It was the first start at point guard for James since 2005, and his passing ability led to the Cavs' recovery from a poor first half. James connected well with the Cavs' outside scoring options, with\u00a0Kyle Korver adding 11 points and registering a\u00a0plus\/minus of +10 in 23 minutes on the floor. James is typically pulling the strings for the Cavs anyway, but it was a little different to see him operating from the point guard position.","published_at":1508895969,"content_id":"2087d4e7-dcfb-33ae-9272-56d40c13400c","content_url":"http:\/\/www.sportingnews.com\/nba\/news\/lebron-james-point-guard-cleveland-cavaliers-cavs-chicago-bulls\/117yx94nuc3131bfb0wqdzpy56?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","content_published_at":1508897715,"content_relative_time":18,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":18,"bot":true},{"text":"No accountability anymore.

Bledsoe, 27, was the No. 18 pick in the 2010 NBA draft and has played for the Suns since 2013. Last season, the former Kentucky guard averaged a career-best 21.1 points and 6.3 assists per game.

Just an hour later, Suns head coach Earl Watson was fired.According to ABC15 Sports, Bledsoe told Suns GM Ryan McDonough the tweet was in reference to him being at a hair salon, rather than in reference to playing for the Suns. McDonough said he \"didn't believe that to be true\" and that \"he won't be with us going forward.\" ESPN's Chris Haynes added more fuel to the fire, reporting Bledsoe met with the team before shootaround Monday morning, was sent home and will not play in Monday night's game against the Sacramento Kings.Wojnarowski reports interest in Bledsoe around the NBA increased once his desire to leave became clear. Bledsoe, 27, was the No. 18 pick in the 2010 NBA draft and has played for the Suns since 2013. Last season, the former Kentucky guard averaged a career-best 21.1 points and 6.3 assists per game. In three games this season, Bledsoe is averaging 15.7 points and three assists per game.Phoenix has lost its first three games of the season by an average margin of 30.67 points, including a 124-76 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on opening-night, the biggest loss in franchise history.","published_at":1508820750,"content_id":"2acdd0b0-e245-3009-a2f4-fb8f2c120504","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/report-suns-discussing-eric-bledsoe-174137492.html","content_published_at":1508780497,"content_relative_time":50,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508828037,"comment_relative_time":37,"bot":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-3b4a3157-e49b-349d-82a5-b326d76ceb5a_a-3c243198-d758-3e1d-8a2a-0d3379b6ac8e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/jordan-bell-threw-himself-alley-621u4ax","author":"third_watch","provider":"SB Nation","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.sbnation.com\/2017\/10\/23\/16528806\/jordan-bell-alley-oop-to-himself-kevin-durant-warriors-vs-mavs?yptr=yahoo","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/sbnation1.vox.com\/e974819cdbbf1bfae4adc1d12e2e2ef2","title":"Jordan Bell threw himself an alley-oop off the glass, and Kevin Durant couldn\u2019t believe it","summary":"Jordan Bell\u2019s alley-oop to himself against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night was one of them.
