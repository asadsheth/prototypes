Who was that guy the Lakers thought would be their stretch 4 of the future but washed out after two years in the G League? Pertinently, The Ringer's Kevin O'Connor reminds us the hot shooting Kuzma displayed in summer league and for stretches of preseason play could merely be more of his general streakiness: \"Over the first 12 games of his junior season, he shot\u00a019.4 percent from three\u00a0while closing the year at 41.7 percent over his final 17 games.","published_at":1507899161,"content_id":"61b01126-b070-3b10-9027-427680776a95","content_url":"http:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/articles\/2737738-biggest-winners-and-losers-from-2017-nba-preseason","content_published_at":1507894786,"content_relative_time":11,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":11,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-aec371cf-eb08-37ab-8fd1-a018cc1d1ea6_a-34b870ba-82ba-334f-9b84-33566b8de9d9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/32-crazy-predictions-lebrons-future-2ncqai9","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"ESPN.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/nba\/story\/_\/id\/21002422\/zach-lowe-32-crazy-nba-predictions-2017-18","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/k7DpwffYXG_2oMkgH8sjww--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_34b870ba-82ba-334f-9b84-33566b8de9d9-768358983.jpeg","title":"Lowe's 32 crazy predictions: LeBron's future, trades and more","summary":"This is the eighth version of this column -- our last big preseason tradition -- and I almost scrapped it.

The goal here is to sift through all the trend lines and intel to make some reasonable off-the-beaten-path calls, and go out on some crazy, ultra-specific limbs. I'd love if all of these turned out right! At least half will go bust. But where's the fun in playing it safe?

Bell played well in July during the Las Vegas Summer League and has continued to impress with his energy and toughness during the preseason when he's on the floor. Could Bell be part of Steve Kerr's rotation when the 2017-18 NBA regular season tips off? \"I'll put him out there for certain matchups,\" Kerr told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"I wouldn't say that he's going to be in the rotation, because he's got a lot of guys ahead of him. ...
