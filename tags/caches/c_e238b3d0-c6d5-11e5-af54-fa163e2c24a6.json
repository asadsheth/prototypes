I can tell you never played competitive basketball.  Besides, David Lee hurt Kawhi before Zaza did.  But again, you probably didn't watch that huh?  Yeah, you're dumb.\n\nFact remains the Warriors were MURDERING the Calves in 2016, easily taking 3 of the first 4 games in the NBA Finals.  They were able to overcome playing with an injured 2x MVP Steph Curry.  It wasn't until after game 4 that LeBaby went on national tv to publicly cry about Draymond Green that got the league to UPGRADE his \"common foul\" to \"flagrant foul.\"  The league really wanted to extend the Finals, not wanting it over in 5 games.  What they didn't count on was untimely injuries then happening to both Iguodala and Bogut, two of the Warriors top-4 defense players at that time.  It was too much to over come, Cleveland got their perfect storm. It took ALL of that to barely beat the Dubs by 4 points in the 7th game.  I rest my case.

problem with Lebron is that he let the people from ESPN tell him that he won the Titles with the Heat by himself with no help and not part of a great Organization, Pat Riley a GM who is a 9 time NBA Champion as player, coach & GM also with a Erik Spoelstra who is a young Coach but has been with Pat Riley since 1995 and has nothing but winning habits all around him and by the way is the coach that started with the small ball play moving Bosh to center and Lebron to power forward and take the center when Bosh was going to the bench, and the team around him was excellent and the basketball system that was designed for him to succeed and achieve what he ever dream because with the Cavs first seven years he barely had any success. 2 regular season MVP's, 2 years of watching from home D Wade & the Heat playing in the playoffs and Conference Finals. Then Lebron in 2006 his third season reached to the East Semis bounced by Celtics while D wade and the Heat won a title that year. Then Lebron reaches the 1 Finals (swept by the Spurs) and then bounced from the second round 3 straight times by the Celtics. Now if Lebron had 7 years with 0 titles and 1 trip to the finals vs the been with the Heat 4 straight Finals 2 titles, 2 regular season MVP's, 27 game winning streak (the second all time), 2 Finals MVP's and got the monkey off his back since people were starting to call him the \"Ringless King\". Let's be honest here Lebron went to Miami tried to steal the Culture and took it back home with players who knew the system. Also we can call Lebron a homewrecker since he made D Wade turn his back on the franchise, the coach & GM allowed him to be successful. Out of the 2003 top 10 picks D Wade won a title faster than any of them. If D Wade would have been drafted by Cleveland, Denver or Toronto just like Lebron, Carmelo or Bosh. He would still be waiting to be a Champion. Great players come and go but great franchises and great basketball minds to assemble winning teams do not come too often...","message_id":"e0d8bf15-99f2-4168-a12f-7f3ff451877d","context_id":"2760d0ca-f88c-3bfb-b95d-bc90b3e5013e","upvotes":4,"downvotes":9,"reports":0,"replies":7,"author_name":"Rafy","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_jd_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"GSYWKH6W5XG4KLZBLKPSEDMKCM","score":0.36788695030371,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-e71d5b66-3859-3968-a0fb-f1603194c89c_a-2760d0ca-f88c-3bfb-b95d-bc90b3e5013e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/jr-smith-shows-subtle-difficulty-3y6etoz","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Business Insider","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/jr-smith-shows-subtle-difficulty-150200522.html","img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/Finance\/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE\/A_comment_from_JR_Smith-228eaacad541cd94d7e8d77d00a5c2f9","title":"A comment from JR Smith shows the subtle difficulty of playing with LeBron James","summary":"The Cleveland Cavaliers made several changes to their roster this offseason, and with them...","published_at":1507907091,"content_id":"2760d0ca-f88c-3bfb-b95d-bc90b3e5013e","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/jr-smith-shows-subtle-difficulty-150200522.html","content_published_at":1507906920,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1507923087,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":false},{"text":"In the West, Cavs won't get out of second round of playoff...
