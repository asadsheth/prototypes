injured again and won't last a season\n- Draymond will put Love in a straitjacket\n- Bron is still better than KD, but with KD's rapid strides in defense, it's almost a draw\n- Between Pachulia and Crowder, it's also a draw.

It's just a matter of if they want to overpay for him plus all the luxury tax etc. To me he's just a good role player, who defends well and has energy.  Although he's not that fast and tends to hack alot.  Terrible shooter and ok ballhandler but not great.","id":"0eb243b9-7090-4bfa-8f23-7447e3a0a92f","context_id":"add58a72-6a72-388b-a8b5-92a57002a667","upvotes":0,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"smokejumper66","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/7ed9d093e5cf1c5eecd5565ccfe47060_192.jpeg","score":0.17032883649179,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-4a2e2423-94bf-3653-9232-52edac99c755_a-add58a72-6a72-388b-a8b5-92a57002a667","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/marcus-smart-wants-remain-celtics-no-extension-talks-yet-5fgtawi","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Yahoo Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/marcus-smart-wants-remain-celtics-no-extension-talks-yet-185719386.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/e51121a055ff23a2065dbf5cc14202b9","title":"Marcus Smart wants to remain with Celtics, but no extension talks yet with key date looming","summary":"Members of the 2014 NBA draft class have until midnight ET on Oct. 16 to reach agreements on extensions.","published_at":1507575439,"content_id":"add58a72-6a72-388b-a8b5-92a57002a667","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/marcus-smart-wants-remain-celtics-no-extension-talks-yet-185719386.html","content_published_at":1507575439,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"NBA"},"created_at":1507656243,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":false},{"text":"The Thunder won't get past the Rockets let alone the Warriors and the George will sign with the Lakers next year.

But the Warriors did to the Cavs what they did to everyone else; they ultimately overwhelmed their defensive principles and rotations. Cleveland's going to look very different this year. The Cavs will play small like everyone else, with Love starting at center and James playing more four, and Tristan Thompson going to the bench. That move was directly tied to Rose being on the floor in place of Thomas. Cleveland would die on the vine with a steady diet of pick and pops for Rose as he's fallen through the floor as a 3-point shooter.
