For me, it all comes down to this, these are the averages of Cavs starters and Warriors starters in the just concluded finals, Lebron 35.5, Kyrie 32.2, Love, 14, JR 14 and TT 5.6 VS Durant 35.2, Steph 26.8, Klay 16.4, Green 10.2 and Zaza 3.2. In other words Cavs starters averaged 100 and the Warriors 92. I understand all the other nuances but one cannot hide from the fact that Cavs bench were ridiculously weak and they are the best now. I have my doubts IT even in perfect health can replicate Kyrie's success but with Love moving to the 5, if IT averages 20 and Love 15, that's more than Steph and Zaza combined and Cavs bench is off the charts.
