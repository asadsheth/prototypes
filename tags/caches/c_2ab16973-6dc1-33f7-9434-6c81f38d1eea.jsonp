Recent advancements point to a potentially disruptive combination of virtual reality and artificial intelligence which will unlock a future with safe and competent intelligent machines, able to learn exponentially through self training and intelligent, realistic simulations.","published_at":1507744651,"content_id":"46d5e98c-c948-33a9-976f-39f55d4b1784","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/tiriasresearch\/2017\/10\/11\/virtual-reality-is-the-next-training-ground-for-artificial-intelligence\/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=yahootix&partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo","content_published_at":1507742760,"content_relative_time":53,"vibe_name":"Virtual Reality","vibe_id":"2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":53,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-8bdeaea3-4c6b-3ed6-b293-413b1b88ec7a_a-abd00b13-8d0f-37d4-8ff4-197e99e29e21","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/virtual-reality\/first-humans-europe-discovered-russian-5b2qeli","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/russia-sungir-burial-faces-first-humans-europe-reconstructed-after-30000-years-682412?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=yahoo_news&utm_campaign=rss&utm_content=%2Frss%2Fyahoous%2Fnews&yptr=yahoo","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/bdMQN6NDfeIqnCRa9K8tzg--\/dz0xNTAwO2g9ODQ0O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_abd00b13-8d0f-37d4-8ff4-197e99e29e21--1031044430.jpeg","title":"The first humans in Europe, discovered at a Russian burial site, can now been seen in virtual reality","summary":"With the right virtual-reality headset, you could meet two very, very old children this week. The children, a 10-year-old and a 13-year-old, are from the Sungir archeological dig in Russia. The site's name is also sometimes spelled Sunghir, but\u00a0regardless of how you spell the name, it's considered an important place for human archeological history. The site is the farthest north that researchers have found early humans living. At least one adult was\u00a0also buried there around 34,000 years ago. Archaeologists have sequenced the DNA\u00a0of the people at the Sungir site, and the results were just published in Science.
