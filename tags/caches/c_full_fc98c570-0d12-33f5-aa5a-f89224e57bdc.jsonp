Until Trump Decided To Ditch It\" - IBD June 2, 2017. \"James Hansen, the undisputed hero of the climate-change movement, called the Paris deal \"a fraud really, a fake. \u2026 It's just worthless words. There is no action, just promises.\" A joint letter signed by nearly a dozen top climate scientists said the agreement suffered \"deadly flaws lying just beneath its veneer of success.\" These scientists complained that the agreement could actually be counterproductive, since it gave the impression that global warming was being dealt with when in fact it wasn't. A study in the peer-reviewed journal Global Policy said that even if every country lived up to its CO2 emission reduction promises through 2030, the Paris deal would \"likely reduce global temperature rise about 0.17\u00b0C in 2100.\" \"Current climate policy promises will do little to stabilize the climate and their impact will be undetectable for many decades,\" the study concluded. Kevin Anderson, a climate-change professor at the University of Manchester told the London Independent that the Paris deal was \"worse than inept\" and that it \"risks locking in failure.\" Friends of the Earth International labeled it \"a sham of a deal\" that will \"fail to deliver.\" \"Politicians say it is a fair and ambitious deal,\" the group's Dipti Bhatnagar said, \"yet it is the complete opposite. People are being deceived.\" New Internationalist magazine said it was \"a disaster for the world's most vulnerable people.\" Physicist Mark Buchanan, writing in Bloomberg View, called the Paris agreement an \"abject failure.\" Nick Fillmore, in a piece for the left-wing Huffington Post, said that politicians had \"convinced themselves and the compliant mainstream media that the accord all 195 countries signed was an amazing breakthrough document.\" Despite the \"lofty language and idealistic goals,\" it is, Fillmore said, \"totally lacking in legally binding mechanisms that will hold governments to emission limits that will stop global warming from reaching devastatingly high levels.\" We could go on, but you get the picture.\" Thankfully Trump can read the writing between the hysteria.","message_id":"93538bef-b6d8-4ea1-9676-32dd41cdde99","context_id":"13d2acba-b414-3373-92e1-a377763c5d03","upvotes":12,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"K

Multiple agencies have been reprimanded for \"falsifying data\". Over 2000 Ph.D. written papers on climate change as well as global warming must be rewritten because the data is flawed. Gore created a $55 billion industry and had 97% of all allowed published papers in complete agreement with his agenda...and they were compensated with fat grants. No opposing papers were even accepted for years. Even the variables used to \"prove\" Gore's claims showed warming stopped in the late 70's. Right after a Solar Maximum ended. Now, all of that money has been frozen by the panel of climate experts who decided who gets the grants...and will not disperse funding to those who have been tasked with rewriting their justifications. The variables used do not consider volcanic or solar influence...the token addition of one volcano when there are currently over 30 Worldwide erupting daily is laughable at best. Dr. Ben Davidson and others called them all out and now the cat is out of the bag. The revised (fake created) data made the climate accord agreements void due to flawed research methods. President Trump was advised of this and exited the accord agreement group. I am not surprised how few know about the bad data...it is published in Science journals and the media wants you to know what celebrity did something stupid. I did my homework, and until you do as well, you have no clue how bad you were lied to. Because of Gore you have Chemtrails and your beautiful skies are gone...based upon flawed and faked data...and they are trying to \"fix\" what isn't even happening. It is the opposite. When this Solar Maximum ends the Earth will cool. As it has cycled for millions of years. This Winter will clearly show you Gore is wrong and the next several will be progressively worse with shorter milder Summers. Basically, the Sun goes Solar Minimum as it is headed as we speak...and we have a mini ice age for the duration of the new Solar cycle. SMH do your homework...your life may depend upon it. AND...according to Obama's agreement to join that group...the United States gets held responsible for the vast majority of the accumulated damages Worldwide...\"...as our fair share...\" to rebuild the World as Americans pay again. Think Marshall Plan. Think Lend Lease. Think of all the natural disasters we have jumped into and spent billions over the years. Nobody...EVER...pays us back. This was a sham from the beginning, President Trump was advised of the unfair financial burden upon the U.S and the flawed data to support the entire theory...so he declined to join the accord.

The three-oxygen molecule is toxic at ground level, but high in the atmosphere, it deflects dangerous ultraviolet rays from reaching Earth's surface. In 1985, scientists first detected the hole in the ozone layer and realized it was being caused by man-made chlorine and bromine, often found in\u00a0chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), compounds used as refrigerants.

Mercury and Mars are even smaller, but Saturn and the mighty Jupiter, of course, are on the other end of the spectrum. But in the grand scheme of things, Jupiter isn't actually all that mighty at all, and a new discovery of an absolutely massive planet residing in our galaxy's \"bulge\" has scientists struggling to explain how it can even be a planet at all. The new planet, which was discovered using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, is named OGLE-2016-BLG-1190Lb, but what it lacks in a flashy name it more than makes up for in sheer size. The planet is estimated to be over 13 times the mass of Jupiter, which is so huge that astronomers are considering the possibility that it's not actually a planet. Now before you go dreaming of some sort of Star Wars-esque mega space station, you should know that's not the kind of thing scientists are considering. Rather, the planet's unusual size might actually mean that it's a brown dwarf. Brown dwarfs, which are sometimes called \"failed stars,\" are objects so massive that they generate heat, though only in the range of about 300 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, and they're not massive enough to sustain the nuclear fusion that powers main sequence stars. It's thought that the cutoff between true planets and brown dwarfs is somewhere between 13 and 14 Jupiter masses, and with a mass of approximately 13.4 Jupiter masses, this new planet is really pushing the envelope. \"Since the existence of the brown dwarf desert is the signature of different formation mechanisms for stars and planets, the extremely close proximity of OGLE-2016-BLG-1190Lb to this desert raises the question of whether it is truly a 'planet' (by formation mechanism) and therefore reacts back upon its role tracing the galactic distribution of planets,\" the researchers write. The planet is quite far away, at approximately 22,000 light years, so its not exactly something we can go and check, but further observations could help clarify the object's status, and potentially help redefine how science thinks about low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and oversized exoplanets.","published_at":1510097442,"content_id":"f1fdbedb-f1b3-3afa-a857-231db0797fb2","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/astronomers-just-spotted-planet-huge-aren-t-even-232923824.html","content_published_at":1510097363,"content_relative_time":22,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":22,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-91a3b8fa-567c-3b78-a8fc-1465993cfd27_a-b38ce370-7e55-3bf2-9ea9-59e0c7686fa4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/proxima-centauri-cold-dust-belt-3gl9be9","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Universe Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.universetoday.com\/137783\/proxima-centauri-cold-dust-belt-indicate-even-planets\/","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/KTd.j9IIND7nCnLhKVY8hg--\/dz0xMjgwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b38ce370-7e55-3bf2-9ea9-59e0c7686fa4--1888449776.jpeg","title":"Proxima Centauri has a Cold Dust Belt that Could Indicate Even More Planets","summary":"Proxima Centauri, in addition to being the closest star system to our own, is also the home of the closest exoplanet to Earth. The existence of this planet, Proxima b, was first announced in August of 2016 and then confirmed later that month. The news was met with a great deal of excitement, and a fair of skepticism, as numerous studies followed t were dedicated to determining if this planet could in fact be habitable. Another important question has been whether or not Proxima Centauri could have any more objects orbiting it. According to a recent study by an international team of astronomers, Proxima Centauri is also home to a belt of cold dust and debris that is similar to the Main Asteroid","published_at":1510091466,"content_id":"b38ce370-7e55-3bf2-9ea9-59e0c7686fa4","content_url":"https:\/\/www.universetoday.com\/137783\/proxima-centauri-cold-dust-belt-indicate-even-planets\/","content_published_at":1510085896,"content_relative_time":25,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":true}]);
