Today, NASA scientists presented their findings in a pair of researcher papers published in Science and hosted a live stream to explain it to the world. So, did NASA find evidence of aliens? Well, not quite, but we might be getting closer. NASA announced that the Curiosity rover has discovered what scientists describe as \"organic molecules\" in rock layers drilled into by the rover. These rock layers date back nearly four billion years, to a time when Mars is thought to have been a much friendlier place for life. This is incredibly exciting news, but it comes with a big asterisk. NASA is quick to point out that this isn't indisputable evidence for the existence of previous life on Mars. These organic compounds may have indeed come from life forms on the Martian surface billions of years ago, but that's not the only way they could have been created. The researchers point out that there are other natural processes by which these compounds could have formed, but because they were discovered in an area of the planet that scientists think was once habitable, it's worth a whole lot of attention. In addition to the discovery of these special compounds, NASA is reporting today that its measurements of methane in the Martian atmosphere are pretty wild, too. Scientists using Curiosity's high-powered instruments have detected large spikes in the levels of methane in the atmosphere from season to season, and the source of it is still a mystery. It's thought that the methane is being created from reactions between rock and water beneath the planet's surface, but it's also possible that it could by a byproduct of microbial activity, meaning the presence of Martian life, albeit very tiny. These revelations might seem like just a big tease, but they're incredibly important steps towards the potential discovery of life on Mars. If that day eventually comes, discoveries like the ones announced today will be gilded as stepping stones that led us there, but for now we just have to wait and wonder.","published_at":1528394481,"content_id":"8a81663e-4ebe-3aa0-9821-225d8561e82a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/nasa-reveals-found-organic-molecules-mars-may-come-182838727.html","content_published_at":1528396118,"content_time":1528396118,"content_relative_time":4,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":4,"comment_relative_time":4,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"1fadb94c-30d7-30cc-9bc1-c82a24d54e81","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-0bd55003-879c-3f0f-ba71-fa56448c0150_a-1fadb94c-30d7-30cc-9bc1-c82a24d54e81","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-0bd55003-879c-3f0f-ba71-fa56448c0150_a-1fadb94c-30d7-30cc-9bc1-c82a24d54e81","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/engineers-enhance-interactions-between-light-3hh1soe","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"SciTechDaily","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/scitechdaily.com\/engineers-enhance-the-interactions-between-light-and-matter\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/cINIolaf2kvU3kP_YIYBwA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4fGx4yGxwzLvaijnyscb5g--\/dz05NDg7aD02MzI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1fadb94c-30d7-30cc-9bc1-c82a24d54e81-344051460.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3RMNpqlDUpRiLVnhdWvGBg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzI7dz05NDg7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4fGx4yGxwzLvaijnyscb5g--\/dz05NDg7aD02MzI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1fadb94c-30d7-30cc-9bc1-c82a24d54e81-344051460.jpeg","height":632,"width":948,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4fGx4yGxwzLvaijnyscb5g--\/dz05NDg7aD02MzI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1fadb94c-30d7-30cc-9bc1-c82a24d54e81-344051460.jpeg","imgw":948,"imgh":632,"title":"Engineers Enhance the Interactions Between Light and Matter","summary":"A new way of enhancing the interactions between light and matter, developed by researchers at MIT and Israel's Technion, could someday lead to more efficient solar cells that collect a wider range of light wavelengths, and new kinds of lasers and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that could have fully tunable color emissions. The fundamental principle behind the new approach is a way to get the momentum of light particles, called photons, to more closely match that of electrons, which is normally many orders of magnitude greater. Because of the huge disparity in momentum, these particles usually interact very weakly; bringing their momenta closer together enables much greater control over their interactions, which could enable new kinds of basic research on these processes as well as a host of new applications, the researchers say. The new findings, based on a theoretical study, are being published today in the journal Nature Photonics in a paper by Yaniv Kurman of Technion (the Israel Institute of Technology, in Haifa); MIT graduate student Nicholas Rivera; MIT postdoc Thomas Christensen; John Joannopoulos, the Francis Wright Davis Professor of Physics at MIT; Marin Solja\u010di\u0107, professor of physics at MIT; Ido Kaminer, a professor of physics at Technion and former MIT postdoc; and Shai Tsesses and Meir Orenstein at Technion.","published_at":1528391831,"content_id":"1fadb94c-30d7-30cc-9bc1-c82a24d54e81","content_url":"https:\/\/scitechdaily.com\/engineers-enhance-the-interactions-between-light-and-matter\/","content_published_at":1528347600,"content_time":1528347600,"content_relative_time":18,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":18,"comment_relative_time":18,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"ecf20776-2775-30ea-929f-58cd925e5a85","post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-966ff003-5bf4-3c00-af21-a7a7065c201a_a-ecf20776-2775-30ea-929f-58cd925e5a85","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-966ff003-5bf4-3c00-af21-a7a7065c201a_a-ecf20776-2775-30ea-929f-58cd925e5a85","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/could-create-bottomless-pit-earth-1ay6nba","author":"nanook","provider":"Forbes","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/startswithabang\/2018\/06\/07\/could-we-create-a-bottomless-pit-on-earth\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/iobHi8zkKFYGZCgr0dy57A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EZ0RKZqEbOEwmSLrHoSykA--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ecf20776-2775-30ea-929f-58cd925e5a85-1534230399.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/O6raAryBqf7KN3tWOXOTEg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MzQ7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EZ0RKZqEbOEwmSLrHoSykA--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ecf20776-2775-30ea-929f-58cd925e5a85-1534230399.jpeg","height":434,"width":640,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/EZ0RKZqEbOEwmSLrHoSykA--\/dz02NDA7aD00MzQ7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ecf20776-2775-30ea-929f-58cd925e5a85-1534230399.jpeg","imgw":640,"imgh":434,"title":"Could We Create A Bottomless Pit On Earth?","summary":"Out in the countryside of rural America, you can find all sorts of attractions that are too-good-to-be-true.

\"telomerase.\" UCLA researchers report in the journal Cell the deepest scientific understanding yet of this once-mysterious enzyme, whose catalytic core -- where most of its activity occurs -- can now be seen in near atomic resolution. \"We're now seeing not just the face of the clock, we're seeing how the components inside interact to make it work,\" said Juli Feigon, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry in the UCLA College and a senior author of the study. \"At each step, we zoom in closer and see more and more details, and can now begin to deduce not just what the enzyme looks like, but also how it

Permanently cloaked in a veil of gas and dust, the objects appear to be wholly natural and are thought to span the astrophysical gap between gas clouds and compact stellar-type objects. As Keck Observatory reports, they look like gas clouds but behave like stars . Dubbed 'G-objects,' the latest infrared target sources associated with these objects were announced by UCLA postdoctoral scholar Anna Ciurlo at today's American Astronomical Society Meeting in Denver. Ciurlo led a team of researchers that analyzed 12 years of data taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory on Maunakea, Hawaii.
