It is literally historic. That's how lopsided the calls were. This never happened before and then add in the fact that a very similarly called game occurred last year, and without question, there is something wrong here.  \n\nI also love how they attempt to come up with the declined calls narrative where only two calls were declined by the Eagles, both which were basically automatic calls.  They also left out the fact that Carolina declined multiple calls as well, one of which I know was unquestionably subjective.","message_id":"b8532573-1ea6-44c9-8e50-eba66ebd9f9f","context_id":"1fe9f7ae-0caf-3ce4-b68e-76b7565065c5","upvotes":12,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"D","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ad.jpg","author_guid":"VBTZU7WJ7MT46YBMI2LQG7XNQ4","score":0.78975312700842,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-2e69145f-75a4-3832-bc09-34e7d22afd60_a-1fe9f7ae-0caf-3ce4-b68e-76b7565065c5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/nfl-referees-association-refutes-claims-referee-pete-morelli-bias-vs-eagles-30hhqvd","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-referees-association-refutes-claims-referee-pete-morelli-bias-vs-eagles-164508675.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/b113b3d01f104eb88800b0e7ae25a16b","title":"NFL Referees Association refutes claims of referee Pete Morelli bias vs. Eagles","summary":"Philadelphia Eagles fans have been so loud about their distaste for referee Pete Morelli and his crew that the NFL Referees Association felt the need to put out a statement.","published_at":1508431508,"content_id":"1fe9f7ae-0caf-3ce4-b68e-76b7565065c5","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-referees-association-refutes-claims-referee-pete-morelli-bias-vs-eagles-164508675.html","content_published_at":1508431508,"content_relative_time":6,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508435782,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":false},{"text":"the jet touchdown being overturned against the patriots got my attention.

This  is what these players should be doing. Go visit the youths and teach them to do right. Then there wont be any police to deal with.

The game was tied 17-17 with under five minutes left, and the Dolphins faced third-and-long at the Falcons' 29. An incompletion \u2014 or worse, a sack \u2014 would have set up a challenging field goal for Cody Parkey and left plenty of time for the Falcons to rally. There was no incompletion.

How many games do the Bears have to win for John Fox to keep his job? The surprise implicit in the question is that Fox actually might get to stick around beyond this year. Coach as sacrificial victim is nothing new. A team loses and somebody has to pay. A team loses and loses and, depending on how long his contract is, the coach eventually has to go. There is no proportion or perspective to these things. With just nine victories in 32 games in his first two years there long has been an assumption this season is it for Fox.
