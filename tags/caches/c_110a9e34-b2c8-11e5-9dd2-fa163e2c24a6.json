It is not so easy to be one of those women and be forced into a situation where you have to decide between letting a man be inappropriate with you or letting a man with all the power ruin everything you've worked for. Can you honestly say it would be easy to make that decision? Trust me, it isn't and in a culture where rape and sexual assault are widely looked at as \"lesser crimes\", it makes it even that much harder to make the decision to come forward. 14 years ago I was raped. Even back then I had seen and heart too many stories of women coming forward only to have no one believe them or worse yet accuse them of bringing in on themselves or deserving it somehow. I was too scared to come forward and my rapist was never prosecuted. Just 2 years after that happened, I was sexually assaulted by a police officer. He pulled me over for a routine traffic stop and when I told him I didn't have my ID on me, he insisted I get out of my car and get into the back of his squad while he verified my identity. Before doing so, he made me stand in the pouring rain and after not even asking me if I preferred him to call for a female office, he proceeded to pat me down. The pat down was more than invasive. He groped my crotch and firmly squeezed both my breasts before finally ushering me into the back of his squad. I was terrified that he was going to rape me but he didn't. And I didn't report that assault either and you know why? Because who was I? Who would believe me? It was his word against mine and I was a 23 year old nobody. That's what the lack of true care over sex crimes has come to. I can only hope that Harvey Weinstein's fall from grace might just be the turning point and that one day soon, women and men will no longer have to be afraid to speak out because we can finally feel like someone will listen.","message_id":"faf8ce0d-6764-4b8e-b389-508df7416615","context_id":"fe197ffc-23bf-3ee8-a5a7-2ca6021bf83c","upvotes":12,"downvotes":5,"reports":0,"replies":7,"author_name":"Amber","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_A_kl_2_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"TMLR4LGCWHOE5PD63SQXWDCREM","score":0.67357257826067,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-4526b714-77fa-3e89-9014-42e938b924c6_a-fe197ffc-23bf-3ee8-a5a7-2ca6021bf83c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-4526b714-77fa-3e89-9014-42e938b924c6_a-fe197ffc-23bf-3ee8-a5a7-2ca6021bf83c","author":"nanook","provider":"The Wrap","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/game-thrones-star-lena-headey-recalls-harvey-weinstein-174429568.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/TheWrap\/8216Game_of_Thrones8217_Star_Lena-de339bd17ef83f1bf1c19bac5ad7d36b","title":"\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Star Lena Headey Says Harvey Weinstein \u2018Furious\u2019 After She Rejected Him","summary":"\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star Lena Headey has joined the growing number of women who\u2019ve accused Harvey Weinstein of inappropriate behavior.

He drove a Nissan Maxima 255,000 miles.  He refused to get rid of it.  It wasn't that he couldn't afford a new car.  He eventually replaced the Maxima with a Porsche Cayenne.  He just got really attached to that car and wanted to see how far his faithful steed would take him.  The whole time he was babying that Maxima I had to listen to him lament about an early 90's Civic hatchback he was still mourning.  I guess some people just get really attached to their cars.  Kudos to this young man for not getting caught in the trap of sudden wealth where your lifestyle expands to consume your available income.  If these athletes play their cards right, they can have a relatively short NFL career that will leave them financially secure for the rest of their life.  Bank the money and invest it.  Treat the investment income like an annuity, reinvest 20% of it each year and live comfortably off the other 80%.  You are basically set for life at a comfortable level.  Rob Gronkowski on the Patriots is another example.  Supposedly he's never touched a penny of his NFL earnings.  He lives off his endorsement earnings now and his NFL earnings are invested for the future.  These are smart young men.  It's sad that many NFL athletes end up broken and broke after a short 5 - 7 year career in professional football.","message_id":"fb7c87f5-3bb9-4116-b980-48edd14848bb","context_id":"933cd8e9-5715-3f2d-a4f5-f511ccc2e7d4","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Trumpanzees","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/7e3fd079d9468077e67028e4abe7ffe5_192.jpeg","author_guid":"WB6KI2EDVZ3JILNEMQSFK2CKYU","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-2158e2ab-c747-3328-8c8b-e27a673917e5_a-933cd8e9-5715-3f2d-a4f5-f511ccc2e7d4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/dallas-cowboys-running-back-alfred-5rm8syv","author":"third_watch","provider":"CNBC Videos","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/dallas-cowboys-running-back-alfred-125000391.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.cnbc2.com\/df6c19949abb7d6f4f8a45e29c6c594b","title":"Dallas Cowboys running back Alfred Morris drives a $2 car","summary":null,"published_at":1508245817,"content_id":"933cd8e9-5715-3f2d-a4f5-f511ccc2e7d4","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/dallas-cowboys-running-back-alfred-125000391.html","content_published_at":1508244600,"content_relative_time":11,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508259122,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":false},{"text":"First of all Brady got most of his SB rings because of the defense he had and a great coach.

The last two the other team needed just one yard to put the game away and tried to outsmart Belichick, we all know how well that went. So if Brady had gone to the Giants, Belichick didn't coach there anymore at that time. Brady is a great QB, but if he didn't fall in the right place with the right coach, who knows.
