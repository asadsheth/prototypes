[{"text":"These guys just flat out don't get it. You're an employee. There are rules and expectations when you work for a company. There are things about my job that I hate that I have to do. If I were to protest those things, I would get fired. I wouldn't go to jail because protesting isn't against the law, but I would lose my job. This is not hard to figure out. Your straw man protest is costing your company money. No company likes to lose money because of ignorant actions of its employees. You want to protest, fine. Do it off the clock.
