This year I cut ties with the NFL because I do not agree with what they are doing, or the platform they are using for their players' personal beliefs.  I love football  and have not watched a game in weeks.  I have traveled through many parts of the world and have been to many sports activities in other countries, which by the way start with their national anthems.  I stood out of respect for their country and flag.  \nWhat is sad is that I have seen more love and respect come from 3rd world countries towards their flag and country then we do.  I am a proud veteran and I believe if you love this country, you stand and put your hand over your heart.  You do not kneel to show defiance or anger towards a specific cause.  Form and support an organization that supports that cause, but you don't deserve a national platform, that is why the NFL is losing money.  That is the great thing about this country.  I don't support programs or people that don't share my beliefs.
