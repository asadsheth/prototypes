Some have linked the planet to an asteroid called 2012 TC4, which is due to make a staggeringly close pass of Earth on October 12.\u00a0 NASA earth defence specialists are closely monitoring the close approach of the asteroid. Conspiracy theory channel Igor Kryan posted a video entitled 'WOW Nibiru Guys Were Right. NASA Just Confirmed Its Coming October 12' on YouTube. In a promotional blurb the channel wrote: \"WOW Nibiru fears were right: something huge from deep space coming to earth and it is coming closer than distance between New York & Tokyo.\u00a0 Getty \"On October 12 New Yorkers will be closer","published_at":1507469838,"content_id":"73effab2-3953-3d0e-b14a-df2bd54563bf","content_url":"http:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/weird\/858905\/Nibiru-Planet-X-NASA-2012-TC4-end-of-the-world-September-23-October-The-Rapture?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+daily-express-weird-news+%28Daily+Express+%3A%3A+Weird+News+Feed%29","content_published_at":1507468320,"content_relative_time":27,"vibe_name":"Astronomy"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-046dc375-457d-3889-8dc0-70f5bf150a3f_a-fb3e9573-f63d-34fa-b9db-d05f113d6004","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/spacex-bfr-kill-airline-stocks-23ivd8o","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"The Motley Fool","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2017\/10\/08\/will-the-spacex-bfr-kill-airline-stocks.aspx?yptr=yahoo","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hnpjQFcmm7vAHNUCbsefxw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fb3e9573-f63d-34fa-b9db-d05f113d6004-284663403.jpeg","title":"Will the SpaceX BFR Kill Airline Stocks?","summary":"Elon Musk has big plans for Mars, for the moon -- and as it just so happens, for Earth, too. As we learned at Musk's brief talk in Adelaide, Australia, last week, SpaceX is hard at work designing a new rocket ship to replace all its existing rockets (and even to replace one that it hasn't flown yet). Dubbed the BFR, or Big Falcon Rocket, this 106-meter-tall, 4,400-ton rocket will be large enough to carry as many as 100 colonists\u00a0at a time to Mars. Perhaps the biggest impact of BFR, however, may be felt back here on Earth.
