In two recently published studies, two international teams of researchers report on the discovery of five newly-discovered black hole pairs at the centers of distant galaxies. This discovery could help astronomers shed new light on how SMBHs form and grow over time, not to mention how black hole mergers produce the strongest gravitational waves in the Universe. The first four dual black hole candidates were reported in a study titled \u201cBuried AGNs in Advanced Mergers: Mid-Infrared Color Selection as a Dual AGN Finder\u201c, which was led by Shobita Satyapal, a professor of astrophysics at George Mason University.","published_at":1507568815,"content_id":"27a73ce7-cd33-300c-a677-f0a88def2acc","content_url":"https:\/\/www.universetoday.com\/137421\/scientist-find-treasure-trove-giant-black-hole-pairs\/","content_published_at":1507501472,"content_relative_time":48,"vibe_name":"Astronomy"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":48,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-f074999f-2d74-3b82-9f34-c414bf5c0fc5_a-99a17686-024a-396f-bce8-968f8e05f59a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/research-helps-solve-galactic-murders-3bxqrt9","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Astronomy.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.astronomy.com\/news\/2017\/10\/new-research-helps-solve-galactic-murders","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9kODMzS2qrveKDveI6jtBg--\/dz0yMTg0O2g9MTQ3Mjt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_99a17686-024a-396f-bce8-968f8e05f59a-1138764832.jpeg","title":"New research helps solve galactic murders","summary":"Our universe is dying.

Many in the region were celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival and attempting to catch a glimpse of the full moon when the meteor stole the show. The space rock entered Earth's atmosphere above China, near the border of Myanmar, bursting into flames with an estimated energy equivalent to 540 tons of TNT. It produced an extremely bright flash which lasted long enough for many witnesses to turn their smartphone cameras skyward and capture the rare sight. Many onlookers posted their own personal videos of the fireball on China's Weibo social network (basically a Chinese Twitter). The videos show a small bright light eventually growing into a large flash before fizzling out, temporarily providing enough light to mimic daytime. https:\/\/twitter.com\/Yeqzids\/status\/915704155439644672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Fnews%2Fchina%2Fsociety%2Farticle%2F2114147%2Ffireball-brings-mid-autumn-surprise-chinese-skywatchers-seeking While it might look like the beginning of the apocalypse, the impressive fireball hasn't been linked to any damage or casualties. That said, local news reports have noted that it caused buildings to shake as it detonated in sky. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pQquVZk5KKM According to NASA's tracking of such fireballs \u2014 yes, NASA documents every single one \u2014 the most recent fireball of similar size in China fell in 2014, so they're not unheard of, but they sure are neat to look at.\u00a0 This most recent one is thought to have exploded over mountainous terrain, which would make finding any resulting meteorites extremely difficult. For a shooting star to make it on NASA's fireball list it has to meet some minimum criteria. \"A\u00a0fireball\u00a0is an unusually bright meteor that reaches a visual magnitude of -3 or brighter when seen at the observer\u2019s zenith,\" the agency explains. \"Objects causing fireball events can exceed one meter in size. Fireballs that explode in the atmosphere are technically referred to as\u00a0bolides\u00a0although the terms fireballs and bolides are often used interchangeably.\"","published_at":1507341914,"content_id":"49c88dca-7dda-3e4f-ad5f-69df17d17f50","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/watch-flaming-meteor-streak-across-night-sky-china-020314198.html","content_published_at":1507341794,"content_relative_time":93,"vibe_name":"Astronomy"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":93,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-fb1c9b73-b4b9-336f-8156-ed9c1f2bcdc3_a-f3c3819e-bf14-3e77-a627-9085f1351978","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/ask-ethan-many-planets-did-3qz9bds","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Forbes","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/startswithabang\/2017\/10\/07\/ask-ethan-how-many-planets-did-nasas-kepler-miss\/","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/9JLYxhrXHlfCu8ZRAdInqw--\/dz02MDA7aD0zMTU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f3c3819e-bf14-3e77-a627-9085f1351978-251957003.jpeg","title":"Ask Ethan: How Many Planets Did NASA's Kepler Miss?","summary":"How many planets are there in our galaxy? It's a question that, 30 years ago, was pure speculation, as we had not yet even found the first planet beyond our own Solar System. Fast forward to the present day, and we've directly\u00a0found thousands of them, with the overwhelming majority\u00a0discovered by NASA's Kepler mission. But despite Kepler's successes and all these new discoveries, what's more remarkable is all the planets it missed. How many is that? Rudy Siegel (no relation) wants to know: Since Kepler uses the transit method to detect exoplanets, how many are we missing due to non-ecliptic alignment?
