Not only is exploring the cosmos extremely expensive, it also requires a tremendous amount of energy. While solar power will work for some missions, it's no use when it comes to sending spacecraft into deep space. Last week, NASA announced that Voyager 1, launched in 1977, crossed into interstellar space. That means it's beyond the reach of the sun and is dependent on its own on-board energy supply.
