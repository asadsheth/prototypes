There is no real middle ground. The Hornets certainly don't lack for talent. They have Kemba Walker, who notched his first All-Star berth last year at the age of 26. They have a two-way stretch power forward in Marvin Williams who can guard you in the post, on the perimeter and hit a couple 3s for you per game. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist is the lockdown defender and Cody Zeller is the low-key ultra-productive big man who does everything you need to help you win games. So how the hell did this team go 36-46 last season?

While the rest us are penciling in what we think he's going to do with his starting lineup when the Heat opens the regular season Oct. 18 in Orlando, truth be told, the coach with three NBA championship rings (one as an assistant) remains very much undecided. While most expect James Johnson, who signed a four-year, $60 million deal to stay with the Heat this summer, to be the Heat's starting power forward, Spoelstra said that decision isn't set in stone.","published_at":1507571747,"content_id":"00fdf241-8d0d-3258-abd5-acd1eaf5adcf","content_url":"http:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/sports\/spt-columns-blogs\/heat-check\/article177880771.html","content_published_at":1507575120,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"NBA"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-8613897f-a596-34b4-9de3-0bb9e82cc18c_a-2554cd13-d511-3c15-a5ee-c0353488ae3a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/spurs-advantage-opportunities-rout-nuggets-3ewo2st","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Pounding The Rock","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.poundingtherock.com\/2017\/10\/8\/16445526\/spurs-take-advantage-opportunities-rout-nuggets","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zmj1Z12cb7C5wzH66eNMMg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2554cd13-d511-3c15-a5ee-c0353488ae3a-899760908.jpeg","title":"Spurs take advantage of opportunities in rout of Nuggets","summary":"The Spurs' 122-100 rout of the Denver Nuggets was a showcase of this new roster's strengths, as the ball whizzed around the perimeter and the threes dropped, one after another. It was also a statement by veterans like LaMarcus Aldridge and Danny Green that they're poised for strong seasons as they both (potentially) approach a summer of free agency. But maybe above all, it was a story of opportunities being recognized and those poised to take advantage of them. That notion may not matter to any Spur more than Bryn Forbes, who has gone from longshot signing last season, to 2017 Summer League standout, to the 15th man on a roster filled with guards \u2014 and on a non-guaranteed deal at that.
