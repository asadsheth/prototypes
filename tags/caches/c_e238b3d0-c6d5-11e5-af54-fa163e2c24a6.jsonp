I can tell you never played competitive basketball.  Besides, David Lee hurt Kawhi before Zaza did.  But again, you probably didn't watch that huh?  Yeah, you're dumb.\n\nFact remains the Warriors were MURDERING the Calves in 2016, easily taking 3 of the first 4 games in the NBA Finals.  They were able to overcome playing with an injured 2x MVP Steph Curry.  It wasn't until after game 4 that LeBaby went on national tv to publicly cry about Draymond Green that got the league to UPGRADE his \"common foul\" to \"flagrant foul.\"  The league really wanted to extend the Finals, not wanting it over in 5 games.  What they didn't count on was untimely injuries then happening to both Iguodala and Bogut, two of the Warriors top-4 defense players at that time.  It was too much to over come, Cleveland got their perfect storm. It took ALL of that to barely beat the Dubs by 4 points in the 7th game.  I rest my case.

He was on the ground, even came out of the game for a little while.  Spurs had a fat lead.  Shouldn't have rushed him back into action, clearly he was vulnerable.  Perhaps if he hadn't just gotten hurt by David Lee, Leonard would've have been more agile and able to avoid it.  Zaza was merely contesting a shot on a hard close out.

It wasn't on purpose, nothing is \"cheating\" especially when you get flagrants for it!  WAKE UP STUPID.  Dubs are the best no matter what.
