Lonzo Ball will be welcome to shoot The second overall pick, Lakers rookie point guard Ball has a wide range of skills (averaging 7.0 assists, 6.9 rebounds). But so far he shoots only 32 percent from the field and 24 percent from 3-point range. 2. The Lakers' best rookie is... Forward Kyle Kuzma, taken late in the first round, has had an impressive start, averaging 16.2 points and 6.3 rebounds. At 30 minutes per game, he gets plenty of opportunity. 3. Howard can't fall for ball fakes Brook Lopez has quite a collection of fakes and moves. Dwight Howard needs to be careful about shooting fouls. 4.","published_at":1512765828,"content_id":"bcbe88ad-093d-3ae1-965f-c3cc3e49276a","content_url":"http:\/\/www.charlotteobserver.com\/sports\/nba\/charlotte-hornets\/article188823469.html","content_published_at":1512765604,"content_time":1512765604,"content_relative_time":4,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":4,"comment_relative_time":4,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"04010b5a-4ba5-308b-b24f-c3fa24b9a3b8","post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-73044bfe-eff1-3a21-b859-536e30d587ef_a-04010b5a-4ba5-308b-b24f-c3fa24b9a3b8","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-73044bfe-eff1-3a21-b859-536e30d587ef_a-04010b5a-4ba5-308b-b24f-c3fa24b9a3b8","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/popovich-nba-gold-standard-stevens-5sub7pn","author":"nanook","provider":"NBC Sports Boston","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/popovich-nba-gold-standard-stevens-201418091.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/VuXtm3kCoWw6QlOVJ.MAjA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/csnne.com\/350379101edee5648500821b997a2cd0","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/tgx7GqBL_DFz4cp_9_4zag--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00NDY7dz03NTM7\/http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/csnne.com\/350379101edee5648500821b997a2cd0","height":446,"width":753,"tag":"original"}],"img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/csnne.com\/350379101edee5648500821b997a2cd0","imgw":753,"imgh":446,"title":"Popovich is NBA gold standard but Stevens could be on his way","summary":"Brad Stevens has a long way to go to be considered in Spurs' coach Gregg Popovich's class, but he's certainly headed in the right direction.","published_at":1512765250,"content_id":"04010b5a-4ba5-308b-b24f-c3fa24b9a3b8","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/popovich-nba-gold-standard-stevens-201418091.html","content_published_at":1512764058,"content_time":1512764058,"content_relative_time":5,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":5,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"4ffe0c15-e84d-3960-8ccc-ccfe0ae74bc9","post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-339e25c0-a386-3ddb-ad7d-1845653489e3_a-4ffe0c15-e84d-3960-8ccc-ccfe0ae74bc9","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-339e25c0-a386-3ddb-ad7d-1845653489e3_a-4ffe0c15-e84d-3960-8ccc-ccfe0ae74bc9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/knicks-joakim-noah-returns-chicago-bftgpsb","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"NY Daily News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/sports\/basketball\/knicks\/knicks-joakim-noah-returns-chicago-untradeable-unplayable-article-1.3686134?utm_content=buffer7d48f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=NYDNSports+Twitter","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Y871HxBXBwVgj29hSpDQLA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Woh58mhzYrNgkweFTqM_lA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4ffe0c15-e84d-3960-8ccc-ccfe0ae74bc9--2073563782.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/MbXeJPACnTih1FHLiPtipQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Woh58mhzYrNgkweFTqM_lA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4ffe0c15-e84d-3960-8ccc-ccfe0ae74bc9--2073563782.jpeg","height":630,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Woh58mhzYrNgkweFTqM_lA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_4ffe0c15-e84d-3960-8ccc-ccfe0ae74bc9--2073563782.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":630,"title":"Knicks' Joakim Noah returns to Chicago untradeable and unplayable","summary":"It was only last November when Joakim Noah returned to Chicago to a video tribute and led the Knicks to an emotional victory over the Bulls.

Is winning now bad for their future?","summary":"Few expected the Indiana Pacers to be a playoff team in 2018. After the team traded Paul George and lost C.J. Miles and Jeff Teague in free agency, a rebuild looked to be on the table. Vegas oddsmakers pegged the Pacers' over-under at 31.5 wins for the 2017-18 campaign. The brilliant Kevin Pelton had Indiana at 32. Zach Lowe predicted they'd win \u201caround 30 games.\u201d I wrote that the Pacers would give the Knicks a run for their money as the worst team in the league. Welp. The Pacers are 14-11 near the trimester mark. Indiana sits pretty at No. 7 in the East, just a 1\/2 game out of the No. 4 spot.

And in two games against one of the NBA's hottest teams, the Utah Jazz haven't been close. Take two against the Houston Rockets wasn't the same as the last, but it produced a similar result: The Jazz took a thrashing. But whereas last time the Rockets poured on the most points any opponent has all season, this time it was Houston's defense that vexed the Jazz in a 112-101 loss at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Thursday night. Sure: James Harden (29 points), Chris Paul (18 points, 13 assists, nine rebounds) and their friends were great. But the Jazz offense, which has been raging over foes for the past two weeks, took a step back in the team's second straight loss. \u201cThey","published_at":1512701920,"content_id":"63d2391e-72f8-360a-8549-17e2f50018b2","content_url":"http:\/\/www.sltrib.com\/sports\/jazz\/2017\/12\/08\/live-jazz-get-to-size-themselves-up-against-hot-houston-rockets\/","content_published_at":1512720000,"content_time":1512720000,"content_relative_time":17,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":17,"comment_relative_time":17,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);
