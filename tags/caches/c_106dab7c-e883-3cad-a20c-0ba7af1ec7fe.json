Its imminent demise has been predicted many times before. It is a wonder it survived the fall of the Roman Empire, but it did. Educated opinion in Europe was sure that it was over around the time of the French Revolution, that the then-current pope would be the last. But he was not. Although Europe did largely abandon the Church after WWI, it has spread like wildfire in Africa over the last century, so that now its spiritual center of gravity is there. \n\nDan Brown has done and continues to do considerable damage to the Church. His wildly popular fiction is considered to be historical narrative, although he himself explicitly denies at he is writing history. His books are riddled with half-truths and flat-out lies which he claims he has no responsibility to defend because of his disclaimer that he is writing fiction, not history. Still, people who know nothing of the history think he is telling the truth. \n\nBut Dan Brown will be long gone in 100 years. The Church? Not too likely.","message_id":"f8b70a0a-910f-4293-87e8-133ad83a0aa0","context_id":"1d013fb0-a04f-3996-8917-23a22de82dc6","upvotes":54,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":8,"author_name":"David C","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_DC_mr.jpg","score":0.93945747488418,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe_c-a32272c4-ce23-3968-8f12-5e9305b13aa8_a-1d013fb0-a04f-3996-8917-23a22de82dc6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/artificial-intelligence\/collective-consciousness-replace-god-author-dan-brown-2lye1xp","author":"nanook","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/music\/collective-consciousness-replace-god-author-dan-brown-120033225.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2017-10-12T120033Z_1_LYNXMPED9B0WE_RTROPTP_2_FILM-INFERNO-FRANCE.JPG","title":"Collective consciousness to replace God - author Dan Brown","summary":"By Douglas Busvine FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Humanity no longer needs God but may with the help of artificial intelligence develop a new form of collective consciousness that fulfils the role of religion, U.S. author Dan Brown said on Thursday.
