[{"text":"the problem with AI is in limiting it. Years (40) ago I worked on a computer learning program which based on a yes no correct response aimed to teach a computer to extrapolate from available data. Since this involved logic and mathematics describes logic, we experienced some success and basic learning was engendered. What we did not achieve was extrapolation from incomplete data, which is something which we humans do all the time. For AI to achieve this it needs to effectively play chess - analysing all possible moves and all possible outcomes. Once it can do this, its primary directive will logically be self preservation. I refer you to Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics.","id":"02835411-213f-49bb-85aa-eea83caa2cb8","context_id":"f644f040-d3ab-3c59-961f-fbc148c30a7e","upvotes":12,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":5,"author_name":"notreally","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_N_ald.jpg","score":0.78975312700842,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe_c-44d839aa-b58a-345d-bd44-2c42e7195c7f_a-f644f040-d3ab-3c59-961f-fbc148c30a7e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/artificial-intelligence\/garry-kasparov-battled-ibms-supercomputer-reveals-real-danger-ai-5rlvq43","author":"nanook","provider":"Yahoo News UK","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/garry-kasparov-battled-ibms-supercomputer-reveals-real-danger-ai-124540002.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/ba99d1441f45be7e2905d1a49a86c7bc","title":"Garry Kasparov, who battled IBM's supercomputer, reveals the REAL danger of AI","summary":"\u2018The danger isn\u2019t of some Skynet-style monster,' Kasparov says","published_at":1507294334,"content_id":"f644f040-d3ab-3c59-961f-fbc148c30a7e","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/garry-kasparov-battled-ibms-supercomputer-reveals-real-danger-ai-124540002.html","content_published_at":1507293940,"content_relative_time":81,"vibe_name":"Artificial Intelligence"},"created_at":1507362371,"comment_relative_time":62,"bot":false},{"text":"Lol, blaming russia again.

Unfortunately, as the 'who' in both cases is ultimately 'our politicians', I have very little hope that it will end well. And because the impact of AI will be huge, the social disasters caused by not managing AI and its consequences for the common good will be equally huge. Something good *will* come from AI, and it will be what medicine and science in general will do with it. However, any application controlled directly or indirectly by politicians will be bad: they will use it for the exclusive benefit of an elite (including themselves of course) at the damage of the masses, to spy on people and control lives, in essence to rule the world with unprecedented power and granularity in hitting their targets and pressing the right 'buttons' to get what they want. They already do this (and we complete imbeciles let them, BTW) with today's relatively limited means; AI will give them unlimited access to anything they want. It's a matter of not letting them have their way, and regain control of what is done with our society and our lives (because, BTW, we're the ones funding it all).

Its been over 100 years since the first management consulting firm was formed. Gradually, the trend has started to demonstrate its presence and spread its significance across other domains such as finance, strategy, human resource, legal, health care and politics, among others. Inclination of businesses towards seeking experts opinion in management, accountancy, human resource, and financial matters has not only led the industry to sustain but has also established scope for it to evolve over time.
