No one likes to read the facts either, go onto the FBI or CDC websites and look at the previous years crime and death statistics. One will learn black people kill black people, white people kill white people, half of all gun deaths are suicides, more people die each year from diabetes, cancer, auto accidents than firearms, four states make up 90% of the homicide rates in the US and they have the strictest gun laws as well as are gang and drug related, not to mention they are democratically governed. Despite being 15% of the population africian americans commit 50% of the nations crime. The point isn't to bash people but to point out the truth which people intentionally ignore. The data tells the truth but people would rather blame other things and make excuses for poor decisions. Lastly out of the the entire population 0.009% die each year from guns 0.0005% die at the hands of the police justifiably. People like to react emotionally rather than factually when someone dies when all these senseless protests because if they did read and do research it would be obvious that what they are doing doesn't make any sense whatsoever.","message_id":"a728251b-d526-4345-b476-dae131117ca2","context_id":"03a8f68f-7827-3ba9-ba79-1b8e3be2e8ce","upvotes":17,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"brett","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_jl.jpg","author_guid":"KRIOAROH4B6GWPGNASF2WAFOIE","score":0.8376695262521,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-b67c883d-7025-374e-b9c2-f064f3573f34_a-03a8f68f-7827-3ba9-ba79-1b8e3be2e8ce","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/nfl-still-silent-yahoo-numbers-1fjflz4","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-still-silent-yahoo-numbers-102811318.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/f83a02b883d35d8cc98a6cf2850deba6","title":"NFL still silent about Yahoo numbers from Ravens-Jags game","summary":"As the NFL prepares for its fourth and final London game of the year, one item of business remains unresolved regarding the first one: How many people did, or didn\u2019t, watch the Ravens-Jaguars Sunday morning game via the Yahoo-only worldwide stream.

I told him no, because when I booked for the room there was no mention \/ advertisement that the hotel was an exclusive NFL supporter.

matter what happens the Steelers in no way shape or form should cut or trade Bryant for peanuts.  He is under team control for this and next season and has zero leverage to tell the team anything.  Offensive lineman Ramon Foster has also made comments that indicate that Bryant is feeling the heat from his girlfriend and possibly family to try to cash out and try to get a big deal. They believe if he gets cut or traded he can latch onto another team and become a superstar with a massive contract. What Bryant needs to realize is that with his suspension history and inconsistent play he needs to show up to work, shut up, and prove on the field he can be counted on before the big money comes his way.  He is getting very bad advice from those who clearly have an agenda and monetary stake on his career in the NFL.  Quite frankly if he doesn't wise up the Steelers should let him rot on the bench for the next few seasons until his deal is up or possibly look for into a trade that can bring something of value in return to help them win now.  Pryor has been feeling some heat in Washington and has been benched.  He only has a 1 year deal and Washington may be willing to make a deal.  If Washington if willing to listen I trade like that at least should be considered.  Bottom line Bryant need to cut off the leeches in his life, lay off the weed, and come to work ready to put in 100% before he starts flapping his gums.","message_id":"b56af230-33e8-4552-af22-7da872334355","context_id":"9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"PGH247","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_P_ad.jpg","author_guid":"UIL72UCHXIRG2DGSO2S5H6CQX4","score":0.52753718344348,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-3a021159-a7f2-3e69-be3f-384dd79a02dd_a-9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-3a021159-a7f2-3e69-be3f-384dd79a02dd_a-9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","author":"third_watch","provider":"Sporting News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/hints-suggest-martavis-bryant-apos-191524411.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/article.sportingnews.com\/62e8856d0cf364e24e23ab3c533fa231","title":"Hints suggest Martavis Bryant's problem is closer to home than Steelers","summary":"Martavis Bryant appears to be in a difficult situation, and his dissatisfaction in Pittsburgh might have little to do with the Steelers.","published_at":1508951067,"content_id":"9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/hints-suggest-martavis-bryant-apos-191524411.html","content_published_at":1508874437,"content_relative_time":44,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508937586,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":false},{"text":"I love watching the NFL on fox every weekend.

Every other club that drafted a RB this year has been using them like a kid on Christmas morning - Hunt and Fournette are studs, Cook was rocking, Kamara and McCaffrey are heavily involved, and now Aaron Jones has broken out.  And the Bengals might have gotten the best present of all, but they're perfectly content leaving it under the tree.  I don't know what will come of Mixon's postgame comments, but I personally like the fact that he said something.  The Bengals were moving the ball and scoring points early on, and Mixon was running hot.  It was a close game at the half, but Mixon didn't get a carry after intermission.  It's so Bengal-y.  This week, I expect there to be some form of \"punishment\" where Mixon doesn't see the ball until the 2nd quarter, which of course stinks for everybody.

It's obvious he still has the mental tools to figure out a defense. Before he hurt his back he was at his best. I was there at his last great moment when he drove the Cowboys without a time-out down the field to beat the Giants opening night 2015. And most of us saw he still had the skills in his last action when he relieved Dak and took the team downfield for a TD against the Eagles last year. I think he enjoys his new gig because he sees the game from a different perspective. But I know he's burning to back in the game. I think a job as an offensive coach would fit him nicely. In fact I would love to see Tony come back to Dallas as maybe assistant and eventually an OC for the Cowboys.","message_id":"303b83cd-dadc-4f5d-8294-a73a3456526a","context_id":"10dcbe2e-6675-3b57-ab93-7ee1e6767fab","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"j","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/2c9bf3314837c282a77dfec936aaba7a_192.png","author_guid":"VS2BBSMKY6KMMLCYC5L2TXHR2I","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-c3bbaf34-062e-3d28-ac72-f7718449b54e_a-10dcbe2e-6675-3b57-ab93-7ee1e6767fab","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/no-folks-tony-romo-doesnt-want-come-back-play-23aqldz","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/no-folks-tony-romo-doesnt-want-come-back-play-142734094.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/13e633ba2cc4c662088847496f5c3f6a","title":"No folks, Tony Romo doesn't want to come back and play again","summary":"Once again, Tony Romo explained why he's not leaving CBS to play in the NFL again.","published_at":1508941671,"content_id":"10dcbe2e-6675-3b57-ab93-7ee1e6767fab","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/no-folks-tony-romo-doesnt-want-come-back-play-142734094.html","content_published_at":1508941654,"content_relative_time":26,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508980393,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":false},{"text":"Tons of talent, but the immaturity factor weighs on Bryant big time.

Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that the Bears have traded a conditional seventh-round pick to the Chargers for Dontrelle Inman. Inman caught 58 passes for 810 yards as a starter for the Chargers last season, but he's seen his playing time drop with Keenan Allen back in action.

Remember when Ben criticized (challenged) him for dropping passes all the time and he caught that amazing pass in the end zone after doing a flip and between his legs? he probably wants to make up for lost time during last years suspension to prove that he is elite, but hes not getting enough passes. lets face it...he has the potential to be a legend. he just needs to follow his role.

With a rushing defense that's ranked 99th (yards allowed per game) and a passing defense that's ranked 105th (yards allowed per game), West Virginia has had to score 38+ points to win games this season. So, just how have the Mountaineers put these big numbers up on the scoreboard? Well, let's take a look in this offensive breakdown.

Last year, they caught the league off guard with the acquisition of OLB Jamie Collins. It was a risky move at the time, but Collins then stunningly agreed to an extension this past offseason. With the Browns at 0-7, a trade could provide a jolt of excitement, or be a smart business decision to acquire draft picks. Let's take a look at positions in which Cleveland could ponder a move: Quarterback This will be the final opportunity for the New England Patriots to try to acquire assets for Jimmy Garoppolo.
