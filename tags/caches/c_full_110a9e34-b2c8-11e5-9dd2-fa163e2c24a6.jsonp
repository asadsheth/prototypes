Admittedly, I am a Panthers fan.  The Eagles were simply more aggressive, more angry, just wanted it more, were right on top of the receivers.  Aggressive play will get you more flags, but it will also win you the game.  Eagle recievers were wide open, the panthers were covered close all night, so there is where you get the PI's.  I thought one of the PI's was bad.  The Eagles D looked phenomenal last night.  The run defense was absolutely dominant, and that was the difference.
