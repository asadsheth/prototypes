We explained our reason to the hotel clerk. We told them that their hotel were supporters of racism and had no respect for our flag, anthem or our country. The manager came out and said he was going to charge us one night rent as a service fee. I told him no, because when I booked for the room there was no mention \/ advertisement that the hotel was an exclusive NFL supporter. I told him that if he penalized me that I would only object to my cc company and they would null and void the charge anyway. He backed down and did not charge me anything.

Every other club that drafted a RB this year has been using them like a kid on Christmas morning - Hunt and Fournette are studs, Cook was rocking, Kamara and McCaffrey are heavily involved, and now Aaron Jones has broken out.  And the Bengals might have gotten the best present of all, but they're perfectly content leaving it under the tree.  I don't know what will come of Mixon's postgame comments, but I personally like the fact that he said something.  The Bengals were moving the ball and scoring points early on, and Mixon was running hot.  It was a close game at the half, but Mixon didn't get a carry after intermission.  It's so Bengal-y.  This week, I expect there to be some form of \"punishment\" where Mixon doesn't see the ball until the 2nd quarter, which of course stinks for everybody.

Once the league and owners started being complicit in aiding overpaid children who play a game carry out their inappropriate protest I stopped watching. And for all the people that say its their right to protest and they respect veterans I call bullshit. Would you defend the argument if all white people started protesting MLK day and black history month raising our fists in support of lets say the confederate flag or monuments? No it wouldn't be tolerated and we would be called racist. You don't disrespect one thing to make a point about something totally different. The only difference here is people like to justify it because its coming from the black community, which gets a pass generally due to injustices that happened 200 years ago which still are propagated today. No one likes to read the facts either, go onto the FBI or CDC websites and look at the previous years crime and death statistics. One will learn black people kill black people, white people kill white people, half of all gun deaths are suicides, more people die each year from diabetes, cancer, auto accidents than firearms, four states make up 90% of the homicide rates in the US and they have the strictest gun laws as well as are gang and drug related, not to mention they are democratically governed. Despite being 15% of the population africian americans commit 50% of the nations crime. The point isn't to bash people but to point out the truth which people intentionally ignore. The data tells the truth but people would rather blame other things and make excuses for poor decisions. Lastly out of the the entire population 0.009% die each year from guns 0.0005% die at the hands of the police justifiably. People like to react emotionally rather than factually when someone dies when all these senseless protests because if they did read and do research it would be obvious that what they are doing doesn't make any sense whatsoever.","message_id":"a728251b-d526-4345-b476-dae131117ca2","context_id":"03a8f68f-7827-3ba9-ba79-1b8e3be2e8ce","upvotes":17,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"brett","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_jl.jpg","author_guid":"KRIOAROH4B6GWPGNASF2WAFOIE","score":0.8376695262521,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-b67c883d-7025-374e-b9c2-f064f3573f34_a-03a8f68f-7827-3ba9-ba79-1b8e3be2e8ce","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/nfl-still-silent-yahoo-numbers-1fjflz4","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-still-silent-yahoo-numbers-102811318.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/f83a02b883d35d8cc98a6cf2850deba6","title":"NFL still silent about Yahoo numbers from Ravens-Jags game","summary":"As the NFL prepares for its fourth and final London game of the year, one item of business remains unresolved regarding the first one: How many people did, or didn\u2019t, watch the Ravens-Jaguars Sunday morning game via the Yahoo-only worldwide stream.

He is under team control for this and next season and has zero leverage to tell the team anything.  Offensive lineman Ramon Foster has also made comments that indicate that Bryant is feeling the heat from his girlfriend and possibly family to try to cash out and try to get a big deal. They believe if he gets cut or traded he can latch onto another team and become a superstar with a massive contract. What Bryant needs to realize is that with his suspension history and inconsistent play he needs to show up to work, shut up, and prove on the field he can be counted on before the big money comes his way.  He is getting very bad advice from those who clearly have an agenda and monetary stake on his career in the NFL.  Quite frankly if he doesn't wise up the Steelers should let him rot on the bench for the next few seasons until his deal is up or possibly look for into a trade that can bring something of value in return to help them win now.  Pryor has been feeling some heat in Washington and has been benched.  He only has a 1 year deal and Washington may be willing to make a deal.  If Washington if willing to listen I trade like that at least should be considered.  Bottom line Bryant need to cut off the leeches in his life, lay off the weed, and come to work ready to put in 100% before he starts flapping his gums.","message_id":"b56af230-33e8-4552-af22-7da872334355","context_id":"9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"PGH247","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_P_ad.jpg","author_guid":"UIL72UCHXIRG2DGSO2S5H6CQX4","score":0.52753718344348,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-3a021159-a7f2-3e69-be3f-384dd79a02dd_a-9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-3a021159-a7f2-3e69-be3f-384dd79a02dd_a-9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","author":"third_watch","provider":"Sporting News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/hints-suggest-martavis-bryant-apos-191524411.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/article.sportingnews.com\/62e8856d0cf364e24e23ab3c533fa231","title":"Hints suggest Martavis Bryant's problem is closer to home than Steelers","summary":"Martavis Bryant appears to be in a difficult situation, and his dissatisfaction in Pittsburgh might have little to do with the Steelers.","published_at":1508951067,"content_id":"9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/hints-suggest-martavis-bryant-apos-191524411.html","content_published_at":1508874437,"content_relative_time":24,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508937586,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":false},{"text":"What's with Powell being so cheap and the same price as Stewart and the raiders RBs.

I agree that Bryant has the potential to be a highly productive and explosive receiver. He needs to run better routes, get open and catch the ball more consistently when it may admittedly be imperfectly thrown. For instance on the opening play against the Bears, Ben did overthrow Bryant a bit but Bryant didn't exactly go all out and lay it on the line to catch the ball. Bryant can look in the mirror if asking why Ben might be starting to trust Shuster more than him. He may become explosive with another team.

Ban replay altogether because occasionally there is a close call that the author disagrees with?  Every week, replay is used to overturn many obvious bad calls.  A receiver pretends to make a 30-yard catch when the ball skips on the ground -- if no ref is in position to clearly see the ball skip, then we're going to let that \"reception\" stand?  A punt returner steps out of bounds on his own 25 yard line but the ref doesn't see it, and he goes on to run for 75 more yards and a TD... should that stand?  \n\nThe author is probably a millennial who doesn't remember what life was like before replay.  Fans had to watch helplessly as their team would lose a game because the refs didn't see a guy step out of bounds or because they didn't realize a runner was down before he fumbled.  At least now, we can correct the obvious ones.  \n\nAs far as the standard of \"indisputable\" evidence, that's in the eye of the beholder.  Personally, I think the call on the Tate reception was correct, and I understand why they reversed that one.  Yes, I get that there are counter-arguments, but I think they are a reach -- I think the counter-argument is based on someone trying too hard to see something there that isn't there.  When you look at the reception in real time, it's easy to see why the ref might call it a TD, as Tate falls into the end zone.  When you look at it on replay, it's easy to see why they'd conclude he was down by contact at the one-foot line.  I have no problem with the way that played out -- and I'm not a fan of either team involved.  Atlanta fans would've had a legitimate gripe if the TD were allowed to stand; Detroit fans have a gripe that it was overturned.  Personally, I think it was handled appropriately, and I blame the Lions for running a play with no timeouts that had a chance of being short of the goal line.","message_id":"2073d069-d24b-490f-8f43-96e58d32e7d3","context_id":"0e53bb22-4bf4-3260-bd08-f997b41141f3","upvotes":42,"downvotes":5,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"Kevin","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_K_ald.jpg","author_guid":"AJM2OSYGKKBUZH4IWCS4PHPZZA","score":0.86787312892929,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-f9b84e36-6d73-3f92-9f62-d4bfdec8dec1_a-0e53bb22-4bf4-3260-bd08-f997b41141f3","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/__trashed-24-5vm3wgh","author":"nanook","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/__trashed-24-192538900.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/9d01486a6eee218c47ce9bd2158a8880","title":"NFL refs and instant replay are destroying the league","summary":"Instant replay is supposed to make things better in the NFL.

One of those rare occasions when the New York Giants general manager will be available comes Tuesday afternoon, and with this season already having gone horribly off the rails for the 1-6 Giants Reese is likely to be on the defensive when he steps to the podium. The GM has a lot to answer for. Like, his own culpability in a season that had Super Bowl aspirations but is over before Halloween. And, in truth, has been over for a few weeks now. Reese can't be held responsible for the injury that sidelined Odell Beckham Jr. at the beginning of the season and limited his effectiveness when he came back. Or, the season-ending ones to Beckham and Brandon","published_at":1508846033,"content_id":"71b29b47-06e3-3ec3-9538-cf4ab371e851","content_url":"https:\/\/www.bigblueview.com\/2017\/10\/24\/16525242\/giants-gm-jerry-reese-has-a-lot-to-answer-for","content_published_at":1508821200,"content_relative_time":39,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":39,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-f6df31da-83ed-3ace-a294-0a89bc645c9f_a-1d7fe1d2-1f41-32ab-b1f1-a5d9d995202d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/whats-one-trade-raiders-trade-5f7zg4v","author":"third_watch","provider":"Silver And Black Pride","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.silverandblackpride.com\/2017\/10\/24\/16491748\/whats-the-one-trade-raiders-should-make-before-the-trade-deadline","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8Xpf7wJ5hMvrUC5M5biOaw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1d7fe1d2-1f41-32ab-b1f1-a5d9d995202d-1901281753.jpeg","title":"What's the one trade Raiders should make before the trade deadline?","summary":"With the Oakland Raiders 3-4 start to the 2017 NFL regular season, a trade might not be realistic as the defense seems to lack talent on the field and from the coaching staff. So there might not be just one fix for this calendar year. However, if there is one acquisition general Reggie McKenzie can make to help the secondary and to resurrect Oakland's season, what would it be? Here's mine: Jason McCourty The Cleveland Browns are still 0-6 and have shown interest in stockpiling draft selections. Browns cornerback Jason McCourty is having one of the best seasons of his NFL career, 92 Pro Football Focus player grade in 2017 and already had three interceptions in six games this season.

Prior to the national anthem, several players took a knee in the end zone. There's no context to this aside from the tweet but it is important to note that all players did stand for the anthem. But we want to ask you if this matters to you as a fan. Cast your vote and let us know in the comments below.

Two questions pop up; which tackle should they move and which landing spot should they pick? While most teams have three or four, Buffalo has five tackles on the roster and four of them are tradeable assets at this point in the season. (Sorry, Conor McDermott.) Big-time left tackle Cordy Glenn, right tackle Jordan Mills, and backup tackles Dion Dawkins and Seantrel Henderson could all have value to the right team, though it's highly unlikely Buffalo would trade Dawkins, who was one of their second round","published_at":1508862060,"content_id":"5a09101f-dfea-358a-90c0-90efbc414eca","content_url":"https:\/\/www.buffalorumblings.com\/2017\/10\/24\/16533530\/nfl-trade-deadline-buffalo-bills-offensive-tackle-cordy-glenn-seantrel-henderson-jordan-mills","content_published_at":1508821200,"content_relative_time":39,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":39,"bot":true}]);
