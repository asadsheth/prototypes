A your suggestion is ridiculous.  this isn't a 5 day a week job where they want to take 5 minutes out, each day, to pray.  they get breaks, by law, in a full time job.  this is a job where they are entertaining us.  as part of that job, they are representing their employer(the team) and the organization that employer is party to(the NFL).  both of those organizations are subject to the immediate pleasure or displeasure of their consumers(the fans).  we aren't talking about a business where the individual employee is not seen by 99.999% of all customers of that business, when they take their prayer time or whatever break they take for whatever reason.  we are talking about a situation where the employee does his job in front of 10s of thousands of people in the stadium and millions watching on TV.  each one of those people might choose not to go to the stadium or watch on TV, which decreases revenue.  then advertisers pull ads because fans tell them they won't shop with them as long as they advertise during NFL games or are corporate sponsors.  pretty soon, the NFL is seeing a $9+ billion a year business turn into a $2 billion or less a year business.  that is the reality of what these bogus protests are costing the NFL.  in the end, this isn't about players needing an accomodation.  this is about players needing to respect the work place and the consumer.  they are doing neither, right now.  never mind the fact very few of them have done even a little bit of anything to try and help with such a dire situation as they are protesting.  rule #1, if you're going to protest something:  you have to actually step up and do more than just say you are protesting it before your protest is really a protest.  when you say words but do nothing to back them up, you're just an attention seeking pile of trash.  kaepernick didn't do anything but talk in interviews until after it was found he hadn't voted in the election a year ago.  then, suddenly, he was donating money and looking to do outreach work and such.  but by then we all knew he was fake, so it didn't really sell.  \n\nwhat the players want is the ability to do whatever the hell they want, whenever they want, with no repercussions.  but the CBA says that's not happening and so does the NFL rule book.  the fact so many front office people are left leaning isn't helping get this under control, either.  owners, very few of whom don't lean hard right, need to step up and enforce league ruels, no matter how much players whine.  and kaepernick needs to step up, be a man for once in his life, and accept the fact his stupidity and bad behavior are why he's not in the league anymore and not likely to ever be there again, not some grand conspiracy of collusion against him.  nobody is colluding against him, within the NFL.  fans are colluding against him by telling the NFL and their advertisers that they'll be playing to an empty house if he's signed.  that's the extent of the collusion against kaepernick.","message_id":"a0d0e188-f6ad-4123-949e-83f7969f583b","context_id":"a22a016c-602a-3a4a-9fe1-108c11375e04","upvotes":10,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Paul","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_P_ad.jpg","score":0.79921833564971,"created_at":1510128343,"comment_relative_time":14,"bot":false}},{"text":"He's

What people don't understand is the difference between what Rodgers and Brady are working with. Guys like Matt Cassel and Jimmy G can come in and win, a lot, on the patriots. Top to bottom they are well owned, great GM, best coach in league history, and because of that consistently have solid, if at times average rosters. The packers? Dumpster fire without Rodgers. This wide receiving core? Not good. Guys are not athletic enough to get separation, and not strong enough to bully anyone either. Their starting O-line does tend to be solid, but as soon as 1 guy goes down it all goes downhill. The running back is an undersized wideout. And good god- that defense is garbage year in and year out since that superbowl win. Seriously- you don't need an amazing defense, but you have to at least have an average defense to actually win a superbowl, and the packers defense are consistently in the bottom quarter of the league. Brady is amazing in his own right, and even if you think he is better than Rodgers anyways, hopefully this at least proves how silly it is to think \"5>1\" is all there is to know in a team sport like football.","message_id":"a75e66c4-2c62-4b4e-891e-7c620fe389db","context_id":"b4a0b480-4120-31de-b745-007b942da7f7","upvotes":23,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Billy Bob","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_BB_jd.jpg","author_guid":"ZPMQB6HEQSWEQ6KNTWI3EWIFLY","score":0.87248169674821,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-ff99d27d-818e-3cbe-886e-2c31a6fbe4c7_a-b4a0b480-4120-31de-b745-007b942da7f7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/packers-unwatchable-without-aaron-rodgers-2wt31ji","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/packers-unwatchable-without-aaron-rodgers-042255149.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/e98b186a9aa7d2ee42692d02f54ad7b6","title":"The Packers are unwatchable without Aaron Rodgers","summary":"The Packers were 4-1 when Aaron Rodgers broke his collarbone, but they've lost every game since then, and in boring fashion.","published_at":1510099216,"content_id":"b4a0b480-4120-31de-b745-007b942da7f7","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/packers-unwatchable-without-aaron-rodgers-042255149.html","content_published_at":1510028575,"content_relative_time":41,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1510037577,"comment_relative_time":39,"bot":false},{"text":"This is indeed what happens when you let the inmates run the institution.

GB will be just fine.","message_id":"a0b21316-a951-4b38-b39d-670c6536e23b","context_id":"b4a0b480-4120-31de-b745-007b942da7f7","upvotes":21,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Chris","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_C_mr.jpg","author_guid":"X7XX3V5JGH6W2ARIS35G4GWJUI","score":0.81629366565644,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-ff99d27d-818e-3cbe-886e-2c31a6fbe4c7_a-b4a0b480-4120-31de-b745-007b942da7f7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/packers-unwatchable-without-aaron-rodgers-2wt31ji","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/packers-unwatchable-without-aaron-rodgers-042255149.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/e98b186a9aa7d2ee42692d02f54ad7b6","title":"The Packers are unwatchable without Aaron Rodgers","summary":"The Packers were 4-1 when Aaron Rodgers broke his collarbone, but they've lost every game since then, and in boring fashion.","published_at":1510099216,"content_id":"b4a0b480-4120-31de-b745-007b942da7f7","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/packers-unwatchable-without-aaron-rodgers-042255149.html","content_published_at":1510028575,"content_relative_time":41,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1510034387,"comment_relative_time":40,"bot":false},{"text":"What a junk year this has ended up being for wideouts.  Injuries took away a few studs, and it seems like there have been more QB injuries than ever which has severely handicapped WR output.\n\nWithout looking at data, at least qualitatively, it feels like passing trees are more diluted than they've been in the past (clearly guys like Brown and Hopkins still get fed).  My armchair guess at why this is occurring is that the influx of great athletes at DE and CB has generally made it more difficult for passing games to \"do what they want\", and are more often settling to \"do what they can\".  Again, I don't have any numbers to back this up, but even in the preseason I remember noticing that the number of WRs each year who either had 1,200+ yards or 10+ TDs has been on the decline, and this year there are maybe only 5 guys on pace to crack either milestone.  This might also be related to the TE boom; maybe Offensive Coordinators' response to this is exposing linebackers instead?\n\nAnyway, just a thought on how we approach the fantasy WR position for today and in the future.","message_id":"b17ec3ce-9324-4a47-acbe-bb2853b20450","context_id":"da2c4b73-1552-3cae-b349-0ac3a75fff7e","upvotes":11,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Kid","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/6a9ecf8ad4a47e5aadeec8c66dba2f9d_192.jpeg","author_guid":"BHJSHS7F6ZYMMRYNIIK5D24DTI","score":0.81254087307037,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-e71b37e8-a1dd-3a15-89b2-85f2d81e4976_a-da2c4b73-1552-3cae-b349-0ac3a75fff7e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/shuffle-wideout-tight-end-prices-rest-season-63ghh4d","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Roto Arcade","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/shuffle-wideout-tight-end-prices-rest-season-053713052.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-11-08\/65ce7e50-c4d1-11e7-b921-2dcd6a42f54b_week-10-marvin.jpg","title":"Shuffle Up: Wideout and tight end fantasy prices, rest of season","summary":"With quarterbacks dropping left and right, it's been a horrible year for the receivers.

He could have addressed the need for another impactful edge rusher in FA to help Mack. Calais Cambell was there for the taking and he let him slip. He has done this over several seasons now when the Raiders have had money to spend. We also had Zach Brown in the building and let him slip away which would have been an immediate impact at LB. Reggie has been hitting the secondary hard in the draft lately but a legit pass rush helps a deplorable\/young secondary, not the other way around.\n\n Reggie did a great job building the OL and signing Crabtree and he only signed Crab because he was one of the last options at WR that year in FA. I would have signed him the first week, we got lucky, outside of that his FA signings have been garbage.\n\n People talk about him drafting Mack and Carr, yeah that's great but Mack was a no brainer, a circus clown would have know to pull the trigger on that one and Carr wasn't exactly a reach to make Reggie look like a genius. Yeah Jackson has worked out well but since getting paid he has fell off. Also I don't want to hear about Edwards, on a good defense he would be a rotational player, truth.\n\nIn conclusion you have to have a pass rush to win in this league. A pass rush can carry a bad secondary, not the other way around. Get players to get the to the QB and collapse the pocket to hurry the QB to force throws, that helps the secondary tremendously! \n\nThink about it, we are horrible on 3rd down conversion defense, why; because we cannot get to the QB. A legit pass rush would even make a bad D-Coordinator like Norton Jr look good.","message_id":"d2202429-6028-4a77-b14a-73e6970871e7","context_id":"9b5af9fd-e362-37c7-8eaa-328a957983e1","upvotes":2,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"HonkeyT","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_H_ad.jpg","author_guid":"X2ZLL324NIEB5IJFDRDLKC75HM","score":0.47629367141096,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-33d93f2e-9b0d-34c7-bc32-b7361e926b31_a-9b5af9fd-e362-37c7-8eaa-328a957983e1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/getting-defensive-two-issues-plaguing-cdmg0xq","author":"nanook","provider":"Cover32","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/getting-defensive-two-issues-plaguing-112043641.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/cover32_362\/db901ed9c61a570d7d4860dfcbf3e16a","title":"Getting Defensive: Two Issues Plaguing Oakland","summary":"The Oakland Raiders need to play smart, sound, defensive football, if they want to win.","published_at":1510053742,"content_id":"9b5af9fd-e362-37c7-8eaa-328a957983e1","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/getting-defensive-two-issues-plaguing-112043641.html","content_published_at":1510053643,"content_relative_time":34,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1510072183,"comment_relative_time":29,"bot":false},{"text":"Julio $30 is WR 20 with 72 points.

RM needs to step it up and actually nail a draft again like he did 3 yrs ago.......maybe he was just lucky...?","message_id":"72f919d7-00c9-42f0-9223-d071dca9b114","context_id":"9b5af9fd-e362-37c7-8eaa-328a957983e1","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Mike","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/ec88a34e91ee0a58c034e3a392eb1545_192.jpeg","author_guid":"2WZXV2CRF5TZFI7LVYU7CXRONY","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-33d93f2e-9b0d-34c7-bc32-b7361e926b31_a-9b5af9fd-e362-37c7-8eaa-328a957983e1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/getting-defensive-two-issues-plaguing-cdmg0xq","author":"nanook","provider":"Cover32","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/getting-defensive-two-issues-plaguing-112043641.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/cover32_362\/db901ed9c61a570d7d4860dfcbf3e16a","title":"Getting Defensive: Two Issues Plaguing Oakland","summary":"The Oakland Raiders need to play smart, sound, defensive football, if they want to win.","published_at":1510053742,"content_id":"9b5af9fd-e362-37c7-8eaa-328a957983e1","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/getting-defensive-two-issues-plaguing-112043641.html","content_published_at":1510053643,"content_relative_time":34,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1510069468,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":false},{"text":"Bears looking better every week and Green Bay Offense nothing without Rodgers","message_id":"f67ca559-abe2-4e1c-8136-c334ae3d1899","context_id":"4708b2d2-3cf4-3847-b33c-064a1ee67d22","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Wes Sparks","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_WS_nl.jpg","author_guid":"YQVGVJHT7ADSGVIKEDVLTUSBWU","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-9ea50d16-c9c4-3f66-a3b1-a0f8d6115ee2_a-4708b2d2-3cf4-3847-b33c-064a1ee67d22","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/week-10-fantasy-sleepers-mccown-adds-multi-td-streak-tampa-h1n9jdq","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Roto Arcade","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/week-10-fantasy-sleepers-mccown-adds-multi-td-streak-tampa-184359434.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-11-08\/f89bb820-c4bc-11e7-9f6a-eb205400e652_mccown.jpg","title":"Week 10 Fantasy Sleepers: McCown adds to multi-TD streak in Tampa","summary":"Josh McCown has certainly made the rounds, but this week he's planted firm roots inside the QB top-10.","published_at":1510080264,"content_id":"4708b2d2-3cf4-3847-b33c-064a1ee67d22","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/week-10-fantasy-sleepers-mccown-adds-multi-td-streak-tampa-184359434.html","content_published_at":1510080239,"content_relative_time":27,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1510091004,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":false},{"text":"Who should I start?

No one does it better than the Chicago Bears. It's practically tradition ingrained deep into the franchise. Despite the efforts by Chicago to bring along Mitchell Trubisky slowly, or curtail their young quarterback altogether, a newly reinvigorated elite defense has sprung up in the headlines lately. Whether it be coaching or talent (it's primarily the talent), the standard of defensive play that Chicago is used to when it comes to the Bears has returned over the past month. A refreshing ideal in the face of recent incompetence on that side of the ball, no doubt. For frame of reference, in October, Chicago's defense allowed four total offensive touchdowns","published_at":1510103359,"content_id":"62ffd695-465d-35f0-82d8-78e9f0a1bedd","content_url":"https:\/\/www.windycitygridiron.com\/2017\/11\/7\/16620458\/chicago-bears-john-fox-vic-fangio-akiem-hicks-leonard-floyd-kyle-fuller-state-of-the-bears-nfl-2017","content_published_at":1510030800,"content_relative_time":41,"vibe_name":"NFL","vibe_id":"110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":41,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-35163eab-986a-32d4-bb72-d90b8519a322_a-b85e0dd2-3605-302b-abb7-920cbf8b6061","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/disaster-against-lions-offers-sobering-3ymnbez","author":"third_watch","provider":"USA Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/packerswire.usatoday.com\/2017\/11\/07\/disaster-against-lions-offers-sobering-view-of-packers\/","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/HMucMpTb5JV.1zwpaM9QlA--\/dz0xMDI0O2g9NTc2O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b85e0dd2-3605-302b-abb7-920cbf8b6061--195823850.jpeg","title":"Disaster against Lions offers sobering view of Packers","summary":"In the NFL, coaches get fired. They get fired frequently. They get fired suspiciously. They get fired maliciously. They get fired vociferously. Except in Green Bay, where it seems NFL coaches enjoy the job security of a tenured humanities professor. Don't expect the Packers to fire anyone anytime soon, but the seat warmers should be on full blast. Dom Capers has been coordinating the defense since 2009, and while he found early success, his defenses have progressively worsened as the team has had more time to draft and develop talent to fit his 3-4 system. In the last five seasons, including this season, Capers' defenses have ranked 25th, 15th, 15th, 22nd and 25th in total yards.

Since starting 5-0, the Chiefs have lost three of four and have fallen behind the Steelers and Patriots in the AFC standings. Remember, the last team to lose last season, the Vikings, started 5-0 and then missed the playoffs. Meanwhile, a team that started 0-2, the Saints, have won six straight since, are in first place in their division\u00a0and are in position to follow two recent teams (2015 Seahawks, 2014 Colts) in overcoming those starts to reach the postseason.
