Scottsdale police have identified the deceased as married couple Jason and Anne Fairbanks, both 39, their three-year-old daughter and their nine-month-old son. Police did not name the children.

Let me answer your question, Why now? Simple. FINALLY women are feeling more brave and more believable. The other thing you don't understand is how traumatic it is when a man takes advantage of you and threatens you with words such as \"You better not tell anyone. No one will believe you anyway.\" Those words have power and they scare me now at age 63. I can only imagine how scary those words would sound to a 14-year-old YOUNG girl. Why men don't understand how their actions effect a child is beyond me. It effects fully grown woman as well. If you are an abuser, your days are numbered.

Politico reported that the U.S. House of Representatives is holding member-only \u201clistening sessions\u201d this week. These private meetings will cover solutions to possible cyber-security leaks of congressmen's emails and other data, alleged theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of computer equipment and much more. All of this is related to a group of IT administrators, mostly from Pakistan, who worked for more than 40 Democrats in the House, but who were tossed off the House computer network last February by Capitol Police.
