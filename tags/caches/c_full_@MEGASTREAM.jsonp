American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510325431,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":false},{"text":"They should have called the police.

He hated fettucine alfredo and hypocrites. But he loved to tell stories, and you could be sure 75 percent of every story was true.\n\nAlthough a less than average life span, Price did not live an average life. He traveled where he wanted to travel, laughed inappropriately at every chance, read what he wanted to read, and loved who he wanted to love.\n\nHe is survived by his parents, 2 sisters, 1 brother, 2 nephews, 1 niece, and a ton of friends.\n\nThere will be no viewing since his family refuses to honor his request to have him standing in the corner of the room with a glass of scotch in his hand and a cigar in his mouth so that he would appear natural to visitors.\n\nSince funeral services probably won't be allowed in any reputable house of worship, a memorial service and celebration of life will be held at the Davis family home at 3:00pm on Nov. 11th.\n\nEveryone who remembers him is asked to celebrate Price's life in their own way; raising a glass of your favorite beverage in his memory would be quite appropriate.\n\nPrice was killed when he rushed into a burning pet store to save a litter of purring, adorable kittens. Or maybe not. We all know how he liked to tell stories.\nPublished in Tyler Morning Telegraph on Nov. 8, 2017","message_id":"f451a05d-f27a-4dd7-b3e0-89c2dbcc8fe0","context_id":"f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","upvotes":600,"downvotes":12,"reports":1,"replies":54,"author_name":"yupyup","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_Y_jl.jpg","author_guid":"VHTEHUYIGYQX65FT4G56WOQTHM","score":0.96618832734403,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dd323ebb-416a-3b40-b6ef-7e9c677f40d2_c-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf_a-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/news\/v-dd323ebb-416a-3b40-b6ef-7e9c677f40d2_c-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf_a-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"KTRK \u2013 Houston","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/familys-hilarious-obituary-honors-life-214229162.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.krtk.abc.news.com\/5d032b4de3bdcce189d062ac3e0258bc","title":"Family's hilarious obituary honors the life this man actually lived","summary":null,"published_at":1510320513,"content_id":"f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/familys-hilarious-obituary-honors-life-214229162.html","content_published_at":1510320513,"content_relative_time":4,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510286948,"comment_relative_time":13,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"Thanks for the full obituary","message_id":"f451a05d-f27a-4dd7-b3e0-89c2dbcc8fe0","context_id":"f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","upvotes":52,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Joe dirt","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","score":0.94946339235935,"created_at":1510287810,"comment_relative_time":13,"bot":false}},{"text":"It sounds like this young man was loved by all around him, family and friends alike.

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510334974,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"I thought it was virus, but it really is!","message_id":"e2e77176-6d28-43c5-88ec-b5df89860b07","context_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Alana","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_A_ad.jpg","score":0.24725712712079,"created_at":1510336485,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false}},{"text":"pumpkins and leaves... and all he received were six broken ribs?

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510326074,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"Remember all the news stories about everyone waiting on the Olsen twins to turn 18?","message_id":"b6dc64a2-de2c-4b15-a644-425bb4bad319","context_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","upvotes":7,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Kerry","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_K_jl.jpg","score":0.74465315323989,"created_at":1510331065,"comment_relative_time":1,"bot":false}},{"text":"I love it, nothing I would like better than to see this murdering, narcissistic, arrogant prik back in jail to finish the murder one sentence he should have received in the first place.","message_id":"027547a1-a087-45b3-8cf5-90e6cb70d8e3","context_id":"8e2bc820-4075-326f-9a55-9dd66ba93076","upvotes":106,"downvotes":5,"reports":1,"replies":3,"author_name":"kegal44","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_K_ald.jpg","author_guid":"ZCECEXKLRAW7FI5UC3MSJJB6TI","score":0.87856175728667,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-89960113-d813-3351-9ee7-b43131163988_c-8e2bc820-4075-326f-9a55-9dd66ba93076_a-8e2bc820-4075-326f-9a55-9dd66ba93076","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/las-vegas\/v-89960113-d813-3351-9ee7-b43131163988_c-8e2bc820-4075-326f-9a55-9dd66ba93076_a-8e2bc820-4075-326f-9a55-9dd66ba93076","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/oj-simpson-booted-vegas-casino-drunken-belligerence-220426324.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/accce590e447e353020f0e5198a9185b","title":"O.J.

Things star Finn Wolfhard, 14, condemns 'gross' 27-year-old model who sexualised him","summary":"Finn Wolfhard, the 14-year-old star\u00a0of Stranger Things, has publicly condemned a 27-year-old model who appeared to sexualise him on social media. American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510326938,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"He'd be condemned by everyone, lose his career, and probably go on to kill himself.

That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510325952,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"I remember when Newsweek was a somewhat credible publication............35 years ago.","message_id":"7c5576ae-5197-4354-846b-41c00a99f478","context_id":"d1943323-4ad9-34d2-91d5-bb44f75adf42","upvotes":2169,"downvotes":426,"reports":1,"replies":65,"author_name":"No Name","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_N_jl.jpg","author_guid":"UWY6YEFE5A7AMITW6GGVAS3QYQ","score":0.84022558093691,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-d1943323-4ad9-34d2-91d5-bb44f75adf42_a-d1943323-4ad9-34d2-91d5-bb44f75adf42","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/politics\/v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-d1943323-4ad9-34d2-91d5-bb44f75adf42_a-d1943323-4ad9-34d2-91d5-bb44f75adf42","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/rand-paul-apos-pumpkin-patch-002513202.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/e4d402a4babab434cd0a00733a55b1cb","title":"Rand Paul's Pumpkin Patch, Lack of Respect For Neighborhood Rules, Possibly Led To Six Broken Ribs","summary":"Or Senator\u00a0Rand Paul's apparent disregard for basic neighborhood civility that led one of his neighbors to tackle him from behind and crack six of the Kentucky lawmaker's ribs?

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510326030,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"Black Friday prices aren't much different than prices were a couple months ago...retailers know hoards of fools will come out in droves, so they spike prices a few weeks before National Wait-In-Line Day and then lower them back to 'normal' so you think you're getting a deal","message_id":"e7bcf73b-07e2-4dd8-973b-3a1c575f1295","context_id":"364606f4-1940-3999-b8f6-10e1c7dd0ec7","upvotes":19,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":5,"author_name":"DC","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/79cbd447ca50af783d19f789398b9416_192.png","author_guid":"DNHIIFQK5EBOYF6AOD3Y4BYNZY","score":0.80198795444945,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-ceafb8ea-13ba-326e-8577-780d7df5b520_c-364606f4-1940-3999-b8f6-10e1c7dd0ec7_a-364606f4-1940-3999-b8f6-10e1c7dd0ec7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/technology\/v-ceafb8ea-13ba-326e-8577-780d7df5b520_c-364606f4-1940-3999-b8f6-10e1c7dd0ec7_a-364606f4-1940-3999-b8f6-10e1c7dd0ec7","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"BGR News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/best-buy-early-black-friday-sale-ends-tomorrow-153308552.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/BGR_News\/best-buy-store-sign.jpg?quality=98&strip=all","title":"Best Buy\u2019s early Black Friday sale ends tomorrow, and these are the 10 best deals","summary":"We already showed you Best Buy's massive 50-page Black Friday ad, so you know all about the killer sales coming from the nation's top electronics retail chain.

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510325813,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":false},{"text":"I think ABC news reported the truth... reluctantly.

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510328146,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"Here is where you went wrong.

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\".

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added.

Voting for a pedophile means the Republican party has completed conceded the moral high ground.","message_id":"33044aaa-9885-4701-be17-b973600825ff","context_id":"e3f00dbf-e226-30c7-b415-48c121491a7d","upvotes":59,"downvotes":22,"reports":0,"replies":21,"author_name":"Elliot in texas","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_E_kl_2_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"5XICZZIXYDW5XWHJN6LJHLNR24","score":0.7461870873188,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-d60f07a0-5458-3fc6-9b58-ef8ea65bcd5a_c-e3f00dbf-e226-30c7-b415-48c121491a7d_a-e3f00dbf-e226-30c7-b415-48c121491a7d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/democratic-party\/v-d60f07a0-5458-3fc6-9b58-ef8ea65bcd5a_c-e3f00dbf-e226-30c7-b415-48c121491a7d_a-e3f00dbf-e226-30c7-b415-48c121491a7d","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/democrats-sit-back-let-republicans-041809011.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_huffington_post_584\/913ab1fbaef06d29d07f7902756f7580","title":"Democrats Sit Back And Let Republicans Struggle With The Roy Moore Scandal","summary":"Republican senators spent Thursday afternoon fielding reporters\u2019 questions about whether they stand behind a man who is accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl.","published_at":1510287489,"content_id":"e3f00dbf-e226-30c7-b415-48c121491a7d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/democrats-sit-back-let-republicans-041809011.html","content_published_at":1510287489,"content_relative_time":13,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510321506,"comment_relative_time":4,"bot":false},{"text":"Where's the article?","message_id":"a4c8250f-a62e-4f43-b205-435ba2f64fe6","context_id":"f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","upvotes":7,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Gannicus","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_G_jl.jpg","author_guid":"EML3DXQL7ITWY52D5WVKMKRHA4","score":0.74465315323989,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dd323ebb-416a-3b40-b6ef-7e9c677f40d2_c-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf_a-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/news\/v-dd323ebb-416a-3b40-b6ef-7e9c677f40d2_c-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf_a-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"KTRK \u2013 Houston","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/familys-hilarious-obituary-honors-life-214229162.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.krtk.abc.news.com\/5d032b4de3bdcce189d062ac3e0258bc","title":"Family's hilarious obituary honors the life this man actually lived","summary":null,"published_at":1510320513,"content_id":"f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/familys-hilarious-obituary-honors-life-214229162.html","content_published_at":1510320513,"content_relative_time":4,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510315000,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":false},{"text":"Almost as funny as the grave marker with the inscription \u201cYou See, I told you I wasn\u2019t feeling well!\u201d.","message_id":"e0ba350b-8ac3-48e8-b69f-568ab3344206","context_id":"f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","upvotes":7,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"BMacD","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/10e33837c526002a59f576baf596d54a_192.jpeg","author_guid":"XXDKK7PEYB3EUS6AGCUZ4MU2FI","score":0.74465315323989,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dd323ebb-416a-3b40-b6ef-7e9c677f40d2_c-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf_a-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/news\/v-dd323ebb-416a-3b40-b6ef-7e9c677f40d2_c-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf_a-f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"KTRK \u2013 Houston","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/familys-hilarious-obituary-honors-life-214229162.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.krtk.abc.news.com\/5d032b4de3bdcce189d062ac3e0258bc","title":"Family's hilarious obituary honors the life this man actually lived","summary":null,"published_at":1510320513,"content_id":"f41e34c3-3a9e-352f-b0e6-a6fbb38e2aaf","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/familys-hilarious-obituary-honors-life-214229162.html","content_published_at":1510320513,"content_relative_time":4,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510326532,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"Wish the father would have killed them.

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510327208,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"Save for your retirements folks.

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510327621,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"Leftards don't think the other side is wrong, they think the other side is evil.

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510327057,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"Bunny #10 be like Oh snap...","message_id":"584c8263-b1b9-4791-9653-25370d3d1c14","context_id":"150ab8d9-9862-3b50-9d8f-b8bba81455dd","upvotes":23,"downvotes":1,"reports":1,"replies":0,"author_name":"Rahan","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_jd_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"QTEC7BQGO6I5ZEI7I6H2M2CTMI","score":0.68506290553899,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-150ab8d9-9862-3b50-9d8f-b8bba81455dd_a-150ab8d9-9862-3b50-9d8f-b8bba81455dd","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-150ab8d9-9862-3b50-9d8f-b8bba81455dd_a-150ab8d9-9862-3b50-9d8f-b8bba81455dd","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Yahoo News Photo Staff","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/snapcat-felines-bunnies-looks-exactly-slideshow-wp-184353141.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/569b1e56005ffe081dc7af020417caa6","title":"Snapcat: Felines and bunnies look exactly the same","summary":"These \u201csnapcats\u201d have found their bunny doppelg\u00e4ngers in a series of super-sweet photo shoots.

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers.

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510329006,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"It wasn\u2019t until I moved overseas recently that I truly came to grip with how more Americans have than the majority of the world.","message_id":"ed1174c7-5ad6-4e12-8c85-24469b01379d","context_id":"af09b886-8fa9-3a95-b728-b0c7971a2ce9","upvotes":5,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Mustard Tree","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_M_ald.jpg","author_guid":"2F3NLAZAN4VWL7DWA33WS5VPJQ","score":0.59805110735417,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e0cdc39b-060c-3214-bf36-b120fccdf910_c-af09b886-8fa9-3a95-b728-b0c7971a2ce9_a-af09b886-8fa9-3a95-b728-b0c7971a2ce9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/amazon\/v-e0cdc39b-060c-3214-bf36-b120fccdf910_c-af09b886-8fa9-3a95-b728-b0c7971a2ce9_a-af09b886-8fa9-3a95-b728-b0c7971a2ce9","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"BGR News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/home-depot-black-friday-2017-ad-leak-way-150807093.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/BGR_News\/home-depot-store.jpg?quality=98&strip=all","title":"Home Depot Black Friday 2017 ad leak: Way more tech deals than you thought","summary":"If home improvement is on your list of things to do this year and you\u2019re waiting for some sweet Black Friday deals to get you started, then you\u2019re probably looking for Home Depot\u2019s Black Friday 2017 ad.

That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship.

American model Ali Michael garnered controversy last week by posting an image of Wolfhard on her Instagram with the caption \"not to be weird, but hit me up in four years\". She later apologised, claiming \"it was never my intention (nor has it ever been) to sexualise a minor in any way shape or form.\" But Wolfhard, who portrays Mike Wheeler on Stranger Things and appeared in the recent blockbuster It, told TMZ that Michael's comments were \"gross\", adding:\u00a0\"That was nuts. That was gross. That's good that she apologised, it's weird but... it's fine.\" Inappropriate treatment of the young Stranger Things cast has been a hot topic in recent days, with stars including the Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner condemning an adult fan who took to social media criticising Wolfhard for walking past him while he waited outside of his hotel hoping for a picture. \"Damn, seeing fully grown adults wait outside the\u00a0Stranger Things\u00a0kids' hotels etc, and then abuse [sic] them when they don't stop for them is super weird,\" Turner tweeted. \"A) What adult in their right mind waits for a child\u00a0outside their hotel and B) is then is offended when the child\u00a0doesn't stop. \"It doesn't matter if they are an actor... they are kids first,\" she continued. \"Give them the space they need in order to grow without feeling like they owe anyone anything for living their childhood dreams.\" ABuzzfeed article also explored a disturbing trend across social media in which Stranger Things fans have repeatedly placed Wolfhard in sexual contexts, including desiring for him to be in a relationship with his costars. The process is referred to as \"shipping\". Along with fans \"shipping\" Wolfhard and his 13-year-old costar Millie Bobby Brown, others have begun to obsessively \"ship\" Wolfhard and his 14-year-old It costar Jack Dylan Grazer, posting photographs which appear to prove the pair are in a gay relationship. Jack!!! Has!!! Finally!!! Spoken!!!! Stop that, stop assuming the kids sexualities, stop thinking that reddie and fack are the same. pic.twitter.com\/6As23p4ewH\u2014 mic loves will byers and mike wheeler (@theIostsister) October 6, 2017 Grazer took to social media to address the speculation, writing on YouTube \"people need to stop saying that I'm gay and have a crush on Finn. It's getting sort of annoying.\" Wolfhard also addressed fan harassment on Twitter this week, tweeting:\u00a0\"I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are.\" \"Why I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a 'fan' and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous,\" he added. In similar backlash, W Magazine has also been criticised for referring to Millie Bobby Brown as one of the stars making \"TV sexier than ever.\"","published_at":1510304908,"content_id":"f23e02bf-424d-3ab4-9b63-2e7512b789f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/stranger-things-star-finn-wolfhard-090828897.html","content_published_at":1510304908,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1510328641,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"Discipline, hard work?

To kidnap the 17-year-old daughter of a man they believed to be wealthy, and to rob the family's home in the process, according to the Okaloosa County Sheriff's office in the panhandle of northwest Florida.

To kidnap the 17-year-old daughter of a man they believed to be wealthy, and to rob the family's home in the process, according to the Okaloosa County Sheriff's office in the panhandle of northwest Florida.

I also had a nasty habit of ripping off the skin around my fingernails and on the callouses of my feet, which resulted in a lot of blood, pain, and embarrassment. The medical term for this is dermatophagia or excoriation. My doctor prescribed me a few different kinds of medications","published_at":1510326020,"content_id":"37c784fa-d3b1-3128-9bfb-889a7b1160f8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/fitness\/Coffee-Bad-Anxiety-44242732","content_published_at":1510326020,"content_relative_time":2,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-66926816-f85d-3639-b8af-289c558b72c3_c-d46c65f8-4ae4-32d5-a0f7-2375fcb41a95_a-d46c65f8-4ae4-32d5-a0f7-2375fcb41a95","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/taylor-swift\/v-66926816-f85d-3639-b8af-289c558b72c3_c-d46c65f8-4ae4-32d5-a0f7-2375fcb41a95_a-d46c65f8-4ae4-32d5-a0f7-2375fcb41a95","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Glamour","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.glamour.com\/story\/tom-hiddleston-taylor-swift-getaway-car","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YJd5mfSAnHx6CKpN8.cauw--\/dz0xNzg0O2g9MTMzMjt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d46c65f8-4ae4-32d5-a0f7-2375fcb41a95--1775863918.jpeg","title":"Fans Are Worried About Tom Hiddleston After Hearing Taylor Swift's 'Getaway Car'","summary":"One of the most devastating songs on Taylor Swift's new album, Reputation, is \"Getaway Car.\" Not sonically, of course\u2014it's a total bop\u2014but lyrically: It centers on a woman, presumably Swift, using a new, great guy to essentially get away from her ex-boyfriend. The whirlwind relationship is personified with a \"getaway car\"; the first few weeks with this guy are blissful and fun, but they eventually run out of gas\u2014and, in hindsight, she views the relationship as a bit impulsive. Flashback to 2016: Shortly after Swift broke up with her longtime boyfriend Calvin Harris, she started dating Tom Hiddleston\u2014but their relationship ended after just a few months. It's the only relationship triangle from Swift's recent personal life that fits the narrative of \"Getaway Car\"\u2014that we know of, at least.","published_at":1510327930,"content_id":"d46c65f8-4ae4-32d5-a0f7-2375fcb41a95","content_url":"https:\/\/www.glamour.com\/story\/tom-hiddleston-taylor-swift-getaway-car","content_published_at":1510327930,"content_relative_time":2,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":true}]);
