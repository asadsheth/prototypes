Day vs. Indigenous Peoples Day","summary":"A movement to abolish Columbus Day and replace it with Indigenous Peoples Day has gained momentum in some parts of the U.S., with Los Angeles in August becoming the biggest city yet to decide to stop honoring the Italian explorer and instead recognize victims of colonialism. Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested.

Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, appointed a committee to evaluate whether monuments to certain historical figures should be removed, prompting a backlash from fellow Italian-Americans who vowed to defend the Columbus statue, which has stood over Columbus Circle for more than a century. But the mayor still marched in Monday\u2019s parade. \u201cYou can debate the historical figure of Christopher Columbus, but you can\u2019t debate the contribution of Italian-Americans to this country,\u201d de Blasio said at the start of the march.

Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, appointed a committee to evaluate whether monuments to certain historical figures should be removed, prompting a backlash from fellow Italian-Americans who vowed to defend the Columbus statue, which has stood over Columbus Circle for more than a century. But the mayor still marched in Monday\u2019s parade. \u201cYou can debate the historical figure of Christopher Columbus, but you can\u2019t debate the contribution of Italian-Americans to this country,\u201d de Blasio said at the start of the march.

Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested.

Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, appointed a committee to evaluate whether monuments to certain historical figures should be removed, prompting a backlash from fellow Italian-Americans who vowed to defend the Columbus statue, which has stood over Columbus Circle for more than a century. But the mayor still marched in Monday\u2019s parade. \u201cYou can debate the historical figure of Christopher Columbus, but you can\u2019t debate the contribution of Italian-Americans to this country,\u201d de Blasio said at the start of the march.

Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, appointed a committee to evaluate whether monuments to certain historical figures should be removed, prompting a backlash from fellow Italian-Americans who vowed to defend the Columbus statue, which has stood over Columbus Circle for more than a century. But the mayor still marched in Monday\u2019s parade. \u201cYou can debate the historical figure of Christopher Columbus, but you can\u2019t debate the contribution of Italian-Americans to this country,\u201d de Blasio said at the start of the march.

Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, appointed a committee to evaluate whether monuments to certain historical figures should be removed, prompting a backlash from fellow Italian-Americans who vowed to defend the Columbus statue, which has stood over Columbus Circle for more than a century. But the mayor still marched in Monday\u2019s parade. \u201cYou can debate the historical figure of Christopher Columbus, but you can\u2019t debate the contribution of Italian-Americans to this country,\u201d de Blasio said at the start of the march.

Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, appointed a committee to evaluate whether monuments to certain historical figures should be removed, prompting a backlash from fellow Italian-Americans who vowed to defend the Columbus statue, which has stood over Columbus Circle for more than a century. But the mayor still marched in Monday\u2019s parade. \u201cYou can debate the historical figure of Christopher Columbus, but you can\u2019t debate the contribution of Italian-Americans to this country,\u201d de Blasio said at the start of the march.

Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, appointed a committee to evaluate whether monuments to certain historical figures should be removed, prompting a backlash from fellow Italian-Americans who vowed to defend the Columbus statue, which has stood over Columbus Circle for more than a century. But the mayor still marched in Monday\u2019s parade. \u201cYou can debate the historical figure of Christopher Columbus, but you can\u2019t debate the contribution of Italian-Americans to this country,\u201d de Blasio said at the start of the march.

Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, appointed a committee to evaluate whether monuments to certain historical figures should be removed, prompting a backlash from fellow Italian-Americans who vowed to defend the Columbus statue, which has stood over Columbus Circle for more than a century. But the mayor still marched in Monday\u2019s parade. \u201cYou can debate the historical figure of Christopher Columbus, but you can\u2019t debate the contribution of Italian-Americans to this country,\u201d de Blasio said at the start of the march.

Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, appointed a committee to evaluate whether monuments to certain historical figures should be removed, prompting a backlash from fellow Italian-Americans who vowed to defend the Columbus statue, which has stood over Columbus Circle for more than a century. But the mayor still marched in Monday\u2019s parade. \u201cYou can debate the historical figure of Christopher Columbus, but you can\u2019t debate the contribution of Italian-Americans to this country,\u201d de Blasio said at the start of the march.

The overwhelming number of murders, shootings, robberies, assaults, etc., are committed with weapons purchased 'outside' the legal system. The 'thugs in the hood' are not subject to background checks when buying their weapons on the street. Only the tiniest fraction of crimes are committed with legally purchased weapons. So HOW do you address that? You certainly don't do it by further burdening the legal gun owners, and you don't do it by confiscating legally owned weapons. Of course, the demmunists, with their hatred of the Constitution, are already attempting to devise ways to undermine, or indeed repeal, the First Amendment, to silence any opposition to their vastly unpopular viewpoints. They would have no problem repealing the Second Amendment, and confiscating whatever weapons they could find, thereby leaving the law-abiding public at the mercy of the gun-toting criminal element, not to mention at the mercy of the gun-toting Government.

It has noble poetry in it; and some clever fables; and some blood-drenched history; and some good morals; and a wealth of obscenity; and upwards of a thousand lies.\"\n2.  \"Our Bible reveals to us the character of our god with minute and remorseless exactness...

And everybody got off too easy in my opinion in that story.  I think there is a solution to clamp down on the drinking.  If you are caught underage drinking OR contributing to it, you get PERMANENTLY expelled from that school.  If in a university system, such as California's, barred from any school in that system for life.  All fees paid are forfeited.  Units earned up to that point would remain - after all - they were earned.  Same if of drinking age but have any offense such as a DUI or drunk in public conviction.  Upon agreement to come to the school, everybody signs a paper saying they understand these rules.  Then mommy and daddy can complain later, but tough.  And any fraternity that has such a problem is simply permanently closed.  My personal philosophy is that organizations and communities tend to get as much mischief and crime as they are willing to tolerate.  So stop tolerating it.","id":"03a234f2-3f02-4933-854f-446d08f957bd","context_id":"d4901de4-20b8-3aba-8fed-bc68f156bbab","upvotes":8,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"LAWFUL","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/d68b5032549db77c40c9d3027caf7724_192.jpeg","score":0.72445728467099,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-d37ff2eb-2072-3c98-a44d-3646f87319c1_a-d4901de4-20b8-3aba-8fed-bc68f156bbab","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/police-arrest-10-people-lsu-fraternity-pledges-death-4ss6juc","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/police-arrest-10-people-lsu-fraternity-pledges-death-142745106.html","img":null,"title":"Police to arrest 10 people in LSU fraternity pledge's death","summary":"BATON ROUGE, La.

Counting suicides to inflate deaths by 200% is counterproductive to their arguments.\n2. The predominance of the real gun violence is centered in large urban areas and only in very particular areas of those cities. These areas tend to be the poorer areas and the violence is centered around gang and drug activity.\n3. For all the lamenting about white males and their guns, over 50% of all the counties in the US had no murders in 2014. These are predominately rural and suburban areas with higher gun ownership rates.\n4. Black on black gun violence constitutes well over 90% of all gun violence against blacks. Young black males (18-24) have a death rate from firearms 32 times the national average.\n5. There are plenty of existing laws that aren't being enforced that can be used to stop or slow the violence. Plea bargaining down straw purchase felonies to misdemeanors isn't in the best interest of the public and strongly abets the trafficking of guns from states with looser laws to states with stricter laws. For those who lie on the gun purchase form (Form 4473), these folks have committed a felony. It is rare that anyone is ever prosecuted. Just going after these two examples of federal felonies is a quick and easy way to put a dent in the gun violence in urban areas with strict gun control laws.","id":"cb3fc0cc-b93f-4dde-8896-fa1f302e53c0","context_id":"ca5878fd-1569-315d-ba3b-1f534a520fac","upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Tom","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_T_jd.jpg","score":0.64841045908534,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-6a7378a6-e807-3e52-a919-46b308d967be_a-ca5878fd-1569-315d-ba3b-1f534a520fac","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/could-smaller-local-measures-offer-way-forward-gun-z2zr9h6","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Christian Science Monitor","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/could-smaller-local-measures-offer-way-forward-gun-212333484.html","img":null,"title":"Could smaller, local measures offer a way forward on gun control?","summary":"Maybe the American experience with gun violence doesn\u2019t have to follow a dispiriting, predictable cycle after all.
