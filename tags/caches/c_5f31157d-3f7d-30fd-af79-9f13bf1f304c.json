The man was also a registered sex offender whose crime was with girls below the age of 13, which is a felony.  What shocked me the most was how brazen he was.  This sushi restaurant was in the food court where a play area is located.  Hundreds of people standing by while this man was attempting to run with the little girl, screaming for daddy.

Between Weinstein, other Hollywood producers and this kid, why do we still tolerate white males? They look at all women including their own as lesser beings and you know how they feel about other races, they tolerate white females but with any minority person they feel they have rights over our lives. My word of advice, outlaw any more white males from being born for the next 100 years. Women who give birth to a male child with 2 white parents should automatically abort it. If we create a balance and make white males a lower population, these senseless acts of rape & mass shootings will slow down.

Sure people don't like the protests but they still have that right if you like it or not. In fact the ones that are not being patriotic are the ones demanding that they get fired for exercising their right to protest and thereby the protesters are actually celebrating the constitution which this president ignores whenever he dislikes the opposition and by attacking their right to protests he is attacking the constitution. The anthem and the pledge of allegiance were not part of our founding fathers creation but added many years and centuries later. To force people to pledge or stand for the anthem is a step towards authoritarianism something akin to 1930 Germany and Russia not America. He talks about freedom of religion  but ignores the other freedoms guaranteed in the constitution and just imagine the outcry if people were being forced into one religion or the other. BTW the kneeling came about after Kap discussed his protest with a veteran who told him he should kneel as they do when a fellow soldier is killed vs sitting. Funny how he supports hate groups and attacks the groups trying to counter these hate groups and these religious freedom laws are bogus attempts to legalize discrimination.\nThe real threat to this country is Trump and those who continue to allow his attacks on our freedoms.\nYou can't force religious belief or patriotism it must come to one without outside pressure or it is meaningless.","message_id":"fc1ee663-25a7-43c2-a8c4-ca0ceb436cb6","context_id":"e327bcee-e273-3113-a5e5-cd8d80c5d53b","upvotes":1,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Hugh S Citizen","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_H_ald.jpg","author_guid":"CZ3FP6YLKDICWY7LH3Y4YNFFBI","score":0.37768959125474,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-f23966b9-e994-3922-8ba7-96a7860034fe_a-e327bcee-e273-3113-a5e5-cd8d80c5d53b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/trump-touts-first-amendment-rights-religious-groups-3n9ijt6","author":"third_watch","provider":"ABC News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/trump-touts-first-amendment-rights-religious-groups-173015524.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/gma\/us.abcnews.go.com\/trump2-epa-ml-171013_16x9_992.jpg","title":"Trump touts First Amendment rights for religious groups","summary":"President Donald Trump fervently advocated for religious liberty in a speech before a group of conservative Christian voters Friday, citing the protection of religious freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment, even as his critics pointed to that same amendment earlier in the week as he suggested blocking freedom of the press.

When I was 18 I made some poor choices and found myself incarcerated. I was given the choice of sitting on my butt for 6 months or going to a fire camp. I chose the fire camp. I was trained by professional fire fighters and had the opportunity to improve myself, physically, mentally and spiritually. I helped fight fires that threatened Pepperdine University and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as saving the homes of many people. The gratitude expressed by the people that nearly lost everything is something I will never forget. I experienced pride and self worth by giving of myself and getting nothing in return.\n  Had I simply sat around for 6 months, my experience in jail would have been much different. I can't envision any scenarios that would have given me the opportunity to be a better person leaving jail than I was before I entered.\n  I can't speak for anyone other than myself, but my experience change my life forever.

I'm NOT making excuses for him but he sounds OFF. I had a neighbor growing up who was born a \"blue baby\" deprived of oxygen at birth. His reasoning and compassion skills were \"off\" too. From the time he was a small boy he saw EVERYTHING as \"his\". I mean all the things in the whole neighborhoods garages. I don't think he went into houses but open garages were \"fair game.\" To hear his justifications sounded a LOT like this kid. He was told over and over by parents, neighbors and police that it was not okay but he did not \"get it.\" He would return the items and things would be good for a while and then something would be missing again. All the neighbors knew where to look when something came up missing. I had to retrieve my bike a few times.
