But they wouldn't say a word before and took pictures with him even knowing what a slim he was, pictures with their arms around him and smiling the biggest smiles.  I think I got that straight.  Now my point.  These \"stars\" are the same people who are telling all of America that we are cowards and doing the wrong thing if we support POTUS.  What a crock of bs!  They let this moron do this for how many years and because they were afraid the money train would derail.  But now that someone else has courage, they jump on the band wagon.  Does anyone see how ridiculous and hypocritical any of their logic is? To put these people on any kind of pedestal or to take their long winded speeches for anything more than using their celebrity to get a one sided point across that only impacts them and their lives is moronic!","id":"2fd3b998-9a1b-40a2-ad93-36b914e6c211","context_id":"1103b083-a11f-3355-9826-fcf19606bd41","upvotes":22,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Wilber Fartwell","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_W_jl.jpg","score":0.89151593863367,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-2d5b037c-870c-3720-8b6a-c8cfb5efc93d_a-1103b083-a11f-3355-9826-fcf19606bd41","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-2d5b037c-870c-3720-8b6a-c8cfb5efc93d_a-1103b083-a11f-3355-9826-fcf19606bd41","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"People","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/nathan-lane-says-harvey-weinstein-124400878.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-10-09\/dd1250d0-ad30-11e7-a55d-918b9abddd5b_2d172da423a4366a4b4dc286c3d19a79.jpg","title":"Nathan Lane Says Harvey Weinstein Threw Him Against a Wall at Hillary Clinton's Birthday Party","summary":"Nathan Lane: Harvey Weinstein Threw Me Against a Wall","published_at":1507648390,"content_id":"1103b083-a11f-3355-9826-fcf19606bd41","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/nathan-lane-says-harvey-weinstein-124400878.html","content_published_at":1507553040,"content_relative_time":34,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture"},"created_at":1507570605,"comment_relative_time":29,"bot":false},{"text":"Hollywood, home of the brave, kept quiet for 10 years because no one wanted to expose a Liberal.

You wait for them to walk the floor, then give it five minutes so they can go walk a couple more floors and be far enough away to not detect what floor it's on. That buys you more time to do what you want to do. But instead this guy decides let me shoot the guard first? That makes no sense.\n\nThere is much that makes no sense here.
