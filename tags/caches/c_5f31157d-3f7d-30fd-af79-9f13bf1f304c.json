We were at the Jazz & Heritage festival in NOLA.  My step dad gave me a couple bucks and told me to go buy some sodas for all us. When I came back, my mom, step dad, and little brother were gone.  I wondered around for hours looking for them, worried I was in trouble.  At the end of the day, I found them.  Years later, when I wasn\u2019t so naive, and I realized that they did it on purpose, so that they could smoke pot at the fest.

There is a correct answer, an answer which makes the pro-birth crowd squirm. The question is: A fertility clinic catches fire, you run for the exit. As you're running you hear a child screaming from behind a door. You  find a five-year-old child crying for help. But in the room next to that one you spot a frozen container labeled \"1000 Viable Human Embryos.\" You can only save one but not both before succumbing to smoke. Do you A) save the child, or B) save the thousand embryos? There is no \"C.\" \"C\" means you all die. The pro-birth crowd  will never answer honestly, because we all instinctively understand the right answer is \"A.\" A human child is worth more than a thousand embryos. Or ten thousand. Or a million.

Photos of the \"smiling\" rescue first appeared on the shelter's Facebook page on Thursday, and more were posted on Friday. Those photos have since been shared more than 5,800 times.\u00a0 SEE ALSO: Get your fluffy cat snuggles without the cat The post was such a success that the shelter issued an update with background on their facility (it was started by a group of first responders), and a link to a pet adoption form for those looking to take Cheech home. Naturally, the applications rolled in. \"Cheech has MANY applications turned in, however we have tons of great homeless pups available,\" an update to the the post reads. Per a later update, one prospective applicant even phoned the County Sheriff's Office in hopes of learning more about the dog, a practice the shelter advises against. They've even shared follow-up posts encouraging applicants to consider other rescue dogs staying with the shelter. Still, the Cheech updates keep coming: A new update from the shelter said that application reviews for Cheech began Monday. Good luck to the applicants \u2013 the competition sounds stiff.

Photos of the \"smiling\" rescue first appeared on the shelter's Facebook page on Thursday, and more were posted on Friday. Those photos have since been shared more than 5,800 times.\u00a0 SEE ALSO: Get your fluffy cat snuggles without the cat The post was such a success that the shelter issued an update with background on their facility (it was started by a group of first responders), and a link to a pet adoption form for those looking to take Cheech home. Naturally, the applications rolled in. \"Cheech has MANY applications turned in, however we have tons of great homeless pups available,\" an update to the the post reads. Per a later update, one prospective applicant even phoned the County Sheriff's Office in hopes of learning more about the dog, a practice the shelter advises against. They've even shared follow-up posts encouraging applicants to consider other rescue dogs staying with the shelter. Still, the Cheech updates keep coming: A new update from the shelter said that application reviews for Cheech began Monday. Good luck to the applicants \u2013 the competition sounds stiff.

Photos of the \"smiling\" rescue first appeared on the shelter's Facebook page on Thursday, and more were posted on Friday. Those photos have since been shared more than 5,800 times.\u00a0 SEE ALSO: Get your fluffy cat snuggles without the cat The post was such a success that the shelter issued an update with background on their facility (it was started by a group of first responders), and a link to a pet adoption form for those looking to take Cheech home. Naturally, the applications rolled in. \"Cheech has MANY applications turned in, however we have tons of great homeless pups available,\" an update to the the post reads. Per a later update, one prospective applicant even phoned the County Sheriff's Office in hopes of learning more about the dog, a practice the shelter advises against. They've even shared follow-up posts encouraging applicants to consider other rescue dogs staying with the shelter. Still, the Cheech updates keep coming: A new update from the shelter said that application reviews for Cheech began Monday. Good luck to the applicants \u2013 the competition sounds stiff.

Photos of the \"smiling\" rescue first appeared on the shelter's Facebook page on Thursday, and more were posted on Friday. Those photos have since been shared more than 5,800 times.\u00a0 SEE ALSO: Get your fluffy cat snuggles without the cat The post was such a success that the shelter issued an update with background on their facility (it was started by a group of first responders), and a link to a pet adoption form for those looking to take Cheech home. Naturally, the applications rolled in. \"Cheech has MANY applications turned in, however we have tons of great homeless pups available,\" an update to the the post reads. Per a later update, one prospective applicant even phoned the County Sheriff's Office in hopes of learning more about the dog, a practice the shelter advises against. They've even shared follow-up posts encouraging applicants to consider other rescue dogs staying with the shelter. Still, the Cheech updates keep coming: A new update from the shelter said that application reviews for Cheech began Monday. Good luck to the applicants \u2013 the competition sounds stiff.

Photos of the \"smiling\" rescue first appeared on the shelter's Facebook page on Thursday, and more were posted on Friday. Those photos have since been shared more than 5,800 times.\u00a0 SEE ALSO: Get your fluffy cat snuggles without the cat The post was such a success that the shelter issued an update with background on their facility (it was started by a group of first responders), and a link to a pet adoption form for those looking to take Cheech home. Naturally, the applications rolled in. \"Cheech has MANY applications turned in, however we have tons of great homeless pups available,\" an update to the the post reads. Per a later update, one prospective applicant even phoned the County Sheriff's Office in hopes of learning more about the dog, a practice the shelter advises against. They've even shared follow-up posts encouraging applicants to consider other rescue dogs staying with the shelter.

Photos of the \"smiling\" rescue first appeared on the shelter's Facebook page on Thursday, and more were posted on Friday. Those photos have since been shared more than 5,800 times.\u00a0 SEE ALSO: Get your fluffy cat snuggles without the cat The post was such a success that the shelter issued an update with background on their facility (it was started by a group of first responders), and a link to a pet adoption form for those looking to take Cheech home. Naturally, the applications rolled in. \"Cheech has MANY applications turned in, however we have tons of great homeless pups available,\" an update to the the post reads. Per a later update, one prospective applicant even phoned the County Sheriff's Office in hopes of learning more about the dog, a practice the shelter advises against. They've even shared follow-up posts encouraging applicants to consider other rescue dogs staying with the shelter. Still, the Cheech updates keep coming: A new update from the shelter said that application reviews for Cheech began Monday. Good luck to the applicants \u2013 the competition sounds stiff.

called a TRUE BILL. At the very least, she should have been given a copy of the Indictment, which was the basis for the #1 the arrest and #2 the Committal Order to the jail. So she was NOT arrested or held for NO REASON and once the case was dismissed in January 2013, she should have been immediately released.\n\nThis is NOT a case of two different justice systems or a case of poor Police work or even a case of lack of money. It was poor administrative work and poor representation by her Court Appointed Attorney.\n\nThe TRUE BILL Indictment from a Grand Jury STILL requires an arraignment and then the setting of a Court Date, possibly even a prelim, depending on state. The County Sheriff was acting WITHIN the scope of the law, as it was written at the time. The Court Appointed Lawyer FAILED to push the issue and file motions for arraignment or for bond.\nOr, if these motions were filed, they were DENIED based on the law at the time.\n\nThe real problem is that 94% of America has NO IDEA on how a Grand Jury really works, who it is composed of, rules of evidence, witness questioning\/statements and how the 5th and 6th Amendments fit into it because the proceedings of a Grand Jury are Secret.\n\nTo make it simple, the Grand jury system is primarily used to determine if there is Enough Evidence to bring a case to trial. Here in the Commonwealth of Virginia the Grand Jury system is used for ALL Felony cases. In some cases in conjunction with a prelim and some cases where reducing the Felony charge to a Misdemeanor.","message_id":"58e771cf-460e-4fcd-b0ec-8a41b76372d4","context_id":"21501c00-70bd-325d-b241-a2b243f25f92","upvotes":0,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"PJ","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/ec5163b6948a40e508c508faf22298b2_192.jpg","author_guid":"UWQXVQAEJGFC3DMZEXP7O6PCNY","score":0.19003740595543,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-9d00bb43-54c9-30cd-a408-bbb257c6854a_a-21501c00-70bd-325d-b241-a2b243f25f92","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/mississippi-woman-wrongly-jailed-96-days-sue-county-2zpjsxl","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mississippi-woman-wrongly-jailed-96-days-sue-county-205630272.html","img":null,"title":"Mississippi woman wrongly jailed for 96 days can sue county","summary":"Reversing a lower court ruling, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Jessica Jauch was denied \"basic procedural due process\" by Choctaw County and Sheriff Cloyd Halford in being held so long, ostensibly because the court was not in session.

The 49-year-old singer shared a picture with Eddy and Nelson, her younger sons with late husband Rene Angelil, from their Michael Jackson-themed birthday party Monday. \"Can't believe you are already 7 years old... Time flies! Happy birthday, my loves!\" she captioned the image. \"I'm so proud of all of my boys! Mom xx...

If you see the video, you can understand why: In 2016 Shaw was suspended for using a gay slur from the penalty box during a Stanley Cup Playoff game with the Chicago Blackhawks. Earlier this year Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf was not suspended for also using a gay slur. Over the weekend, the NHL immediately conducted an internal investigation, interviewing three people, including Shaw and the penalty-box attendant.
