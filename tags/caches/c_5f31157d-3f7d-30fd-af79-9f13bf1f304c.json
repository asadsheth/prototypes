The Court Appointed Lawyer FAILED to push the issue and file motions for arraignment or for bond.\nOr, if these motions were filed, they were DENIED based on the law at the time.\n\nThe real problem is that 94% of America has NO IDEA on how a Grand Jury really works, who it is composed of, rules of evidence, witness questioning\/statements and how the 5th and 6th Amendments fit into it because the proceedings of a Grand Jury are Secret.\n\nTo make it simple, the Grand jury system is primarily used to determine if there is Enough Evidence to bring a case to trial.
