The father wanted the boy vaccinated.  During their custody battle of November last year the mother said she would vaccinate the boy.  She agreed to it IN COURT as part of the custody agreement.  She then went back on her word and refused to vaccinate.  The judge did not revoke all access to the child.  He gave them JOINT custody.  Meaning the father has equal rights to the child as the mother.  She did not lose custody of her child she only lost primary custody.  Meaning she does not get to exclusively make decision about the child's upbringing and care.  Which is exactly what the judge should have done because the mother broke the custody agreement that she signed and agreed to.  You don't get to agree to something in court and then change your mind.  That is not how the legal system works.

And everybody got off too easy in my opinion in that story.  I think there is a solution to clamp down on the drinking.  If you are caught underage drinking OR contributing to it, you get PERMANENTLY expelled from that school.  If in a university system, such as California's, barred from any school in that system for life.  All fees paid are forfeited.  Units earned up to that point would remain - after all - they were earned.  Same if of drinking age but have any offense such as a DUI or drunk in public conviction.  Upon agreement to come to the school, everybody signs a paper saying they understand these rules.  Then mommy and daddy can complain later, but tough.  And any fraternity that has such a problem is simply permanently closed.  My personal philosophy is that organizations and communities tend to get as much mischief and crime as they are willing to tolerate.

I am 37. I was vaccinated as a child and so was my sibling. We both have allergies, I had asthma. Myself and my sister were always sick. Always. Flash forward to my kids and my sister's kids. I chose to not vaccinate my daughter. My sister vaccinated her kids. Now, my daughter is NEVER sick, no allergies, no ailments, while my sister's kids are both on the spectrum, are allergic to anything and everything, and require constant medication. \n\nMost will say this is not related or that it's not the vaccinations. \n\nLet's look at vaccinations from the past to present. \n\nSmallpox victims were given the dead cow pox virus during the revolutionary war on the battlefield. It worked. Dead viruses are what inoculated people from these diseases. Over time, more vaccines were added. They did help a lot of people. I do not deny this. \n\nThe vaccines of today are not the same vaccines of yesterday. Vaccines are laced with chemicals that are toxic to humans. Pharmaceutical companies WILL NOT give you the ingredients list of these vaccinations. I could be said it's out of greed, but I think it could be much more than we could know. \n\nThe other difference is that every virus has a different strain. Some viruses mutate when given antibiotics. People blame the unvaccinated kids when their vaccinated kids get a new strain of the flu. It has nothing to do with the unvaccinated kid, it is simply a new strain that the child doesn't have immunity to.  \n\nI myself have stopped vaccine boosters. I DO NOT GET SICK. People get the flu shot and are laid up for a week. Maybe it's just me, but I'll pass on getting a shot that makes me sick so I don't get sick. \n\nBefore everyone jumps down my throat, if like to remind people that this lady lost her kids because of this, yet playing along with a little boy who wants to be a little girl is totally acceptable and saying otherwise demonizes you.","id":"fe702bec-d014-4f82-9cee-f4a4e03efab5","context_id":"3642f89f-efe3-3ebc-8023-06a6fcf81b1d","upvotes":20,"downvotes":17,"reports":0,"replies":7,"author_name":"Edward","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_E_kl_6-16.jpg","score":0.57397616912137,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-1cf41456-7066-3946-bcaf-f4f07c17f8ac_a-3642f89f-efe3-3ebc-8023-06a6fcf81b1d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/mother-failed-vaccinate-son-loses-43xhfop","author":"nanook","provider":"Associated Press Videos","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mother-failed-vaccinate-son-loses-203431964.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.associatedpressfree.com\/04dbcd8cb6d8c45d1dbf49ab25ea54a3","title":"Mother Who Failed to Vaccinate Son Loses Custody","summary":null,"published_at":1507754433,"content_id":"3642f89f-efe3-3ebc-8023-06a6fcf81b1d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mother-failed-vaccinate-son-loses-203431964.html","content_published_at":1507754071,"content_relative_time":19,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture"},"created_at":1507799727,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":false},{"text":"First off, I want to say I am in favor of vaccinating children...but what I can't understand is how the court system thinks that it's THEIR place to tell people what to do with THEIR OWN CHILDREN.
