Yes, that's a big figure (and climbing every year), but it's not surprising. Students know what to expect on their tuition bills at the beginning of each semester. Universities, for their part, emphasize their accessible aid packages and scholarships. So what really throws students for a loop? The hidden costs of college. Textbooks. Housing. Test prep. Study abroad. The price tags on these costs may, individually, be lower than those tuition bills, but in total - they aren't. Indeed, these are not inconsequential expenses, especially for students that have limited resources leaving them with little extra to spare.
