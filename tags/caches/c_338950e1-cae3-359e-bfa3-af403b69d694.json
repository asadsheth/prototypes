If they paid that money back I would not have to worry about what my children or they children will do when they can no longer work.  Who can work until they are 75?  How many people can actually save money to retire?  Most people barely make enough to get by.  Why not set up a retirement system where your social security that comes out of your check goes into your own personal account just like a 401k.  Of course then the government would have to not steal the money, which once again does not belong to them.  Perhaps the American people should sue the government for the theft of all the social security money.
