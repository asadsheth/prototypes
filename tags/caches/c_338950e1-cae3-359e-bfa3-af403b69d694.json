Never had there been any rupture of this magnitude even during times of War and multiple Coups because of our joint interest in containing the Soviet Union. My fear is that the present Government has aligned it's self with the Russians over the Syrian and Iraqi Kurdish issues. Our position as it stands is not the traditional American stance in regards to the Kurds but it is the right position at this juncture of Middle East history. The Kurds have earned their place in the Sun, Turkey must come to terms with this fact and settle once and for all the blinding Human Rights issues for their own Kurdish populations. Erdogan may not be capable nor willing, I think it's the latter, to pull this off without open warfare between the parties. It would be a crime if Erdogan forces War with the Kurds when he would not take the War to Assad or Saddam Hussein.

Last week, the Senate and the House took the first steps on tax reform. The House passed its budget on the House floor while the Senate moved its own version out of committee, a crucial step in unlocking the GOP's ability to use reconciliation for tax reform; that process allows the Senate to pass its package with only 51 votes. But almost two weeks after the GOP unveiled its framework for tax reform, the party is already grappling with the inevitable reality that for every tiny change leaders seek, a constituency is waiting in the","published_at":1507562878,"content_id":"df604162-5af0-3f56-a90c-9117fa4cde91","content_url":"https:\/\/amp.cnn.com\/cnn\/2017\/10\/09\/politics\/tax-reform-reality-senate-republicans\/index.html","content_published_at":1507544529,"content_relative_time":36,"vibe_name":"Finance"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":36,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-bd23c3ee-f832-3303-8a0e-8c17b9eb5ef0_a-71f09ab2-76ff-3221-8e7f-48705ca3ad31","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/game-changing-yanmar-50-hp-5n1y5nn","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"newatlas.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/newatlas.com\/yanmar-dtorque-111-turbo-diesel-50hp-outboard\/51675\/","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/6DDYGn9hFevZqFDY5qeskg--\/dz02MTY7aD0zNDc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_71f09ab2-76ff-3221-8e7f-48705ca3ad31-326281003.jpeg","title":"Game-changing Yanmar 50 hp turbo diesel outboard motor begins production","summary":"Yes, there have been precedents, most notably by Yanmar itself, but they are no longer produced and certainly not like this engine. The benefits of the unconventional new German-designed Neander-Shark engine compared to traditional petrol-burning outboard engines now seem overwhelming. The Yanmar Dtorque 111 is lighter and more compact than petrol engines of similar capacity, has double the engine life, is much smoother, offers much better fuel consumption and running costs, produces significantly less toxic emissions, and with more torque much lower in the rev range, will thrust a boat onto the plane much quicker ... and that's before you consider the safety and ready availability of diesel fuel. Pioneering non-traditional technology in any marketplace is fraught with peril, but it is a path that Germany's Neander Motors, based in the Baltic port of Kiel, has been forced to take in several markets, thanks to its two-conrods-per-piston, small-capacity diesel engines.","published_at":1507633366,"content_id":"71f09ab2-76ff-3221-8e7f-48705ca3ad31","content_url":"http:\/\/newatlas.com\/yanmar-dtorque-111-turbo-diesel-50hp-outboard\/51675\/","content_published_at":1507625012,"content_relative_time":14,"vibe_name":"Finance"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":14,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-488c4ce7-d7bf-3510-8e68-03bc1cf6cef9_a-5a7912c6-3faf-3e19-b2ce-e227e778bf5e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/us-army-big-plans-next-jmcc5ns","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The National Interest","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/nationalinterest.org\/blog\/the-buzz\/the-us-army-has-big-plans-its-next-big-weapon-war-super-tank-22654","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/njwncupIH7K7GqAu3oArQw--\/dz01NTc3O2g9MzcxODt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_5a7912c6-3faf-3e19-b2ce-e227e778bf5e--1058241339.jpeg","title":"The U.S. Army Has Big Plans for Its Next Big Weapon of War: A Super Tank","summary":"The Army really needs to think about growth as an operational need,\u201d a senior Army official told Scout Warrior in an interview. The Army is now performing concept modeling and early design work for a new mobile, lethal, high-tech future lightweight tank platform able to detect and destroy a wider range of targets from farther distances, cross bridges, incinerate drones with lasers and destroy incoming enemy artillery fire \u2013 \u00a0all for the 2030s and beyond. The new vehicle, now emerging purely in the concept phase, is based upon the reality that the current M1A2 SEP Abrams main battle tank can only be upgraded to a certain limited extent, senior Army officials explained. The Army's Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center, or TARDEC, is now immersed in the development of design concepts for various super high-tech tank platforms, Army and industry developers said.","published_at":1507633712,"content_id":"5a7912c6-3faf-3e19-b2ce-e227e778bf5e","content_url":"http:\/\/nationalinterest.org\/blog\/the-buzz\/the-us-army-has-big-plans-its-next-big-weapon-war-super-tank-22654","content_published_at":1507618800,"content_relative_time":16,"vibe_name":"Finance"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":16,"bot":true}]
