And as the market reaches new all-time highs, it becomes easier and easier to predict a correction (10%-29%), or even a crash (30% or more), as stocks become topped-out.  Eventually, at some point, it has to happen.  And when it does, sure enough, the liberal left media will be there, shoving a Peacock feather into their rectum as they strut around telling us they told us so, and smearing President Trump with all the blame totally forgetting that they predicted with all certainty that the market would crash under a Trump Presidency and our nation would be faced with an 8-year long recession.  Oh, they were soooo wrong!\n\nThe liberal left media absolutely hates it that under a Trump Presidency the market took-off the day after his election and bolstered mainstream America's 401Ks and IRAs to all-time highs.  When Americans become wealthier under a President, they tend to vote for that President again.  But the liberal left media is at war with this President - how dare he do well!  These liberals do not care if a climbing stock market is good for America and our economy.  All they care about is toppling their opponent, gaining power for themselves so they can force Americans to live like THEY want Americans to live, under their authoritarian style government.\n\nWell, the Socialism experiment ended last January.  Obama is history.  The media brainwashed left base is crumbling and dying as the NFL ingrates are rejected by America and Hollywood elites cannibalize each other as they rat-out the heathen hypocrites that populate their ranks.  Hillary Clinton knows she is all washed-up with new revelations that she and her Clinton Foundation profited via cash bribes from the Uranium deal she gave to Russia.  Oh their DNC pushed Russian collusion investigation backfired as there is no evidence on Trump, but the investigation is uncovering some very telling evidence that Obama and Clinton are criminals.  Today the DNC is led by an admitted Communist (number one guy) and the number two guy is an Islamic Muslim Socialist who would happily cut the throats of millions of Christian and Judaeo Americans.\n\nSo, go ahead liberal left media.  Pumps out article after article of all the bad things that are possible in the stock market.  But I have a feeling for the next year, the market is just going to wink at you and smile as the Dow climbs to 30,000.","message_id":"112119b4-f36c-435e-b5f8-89fb1f8fd1de","context_id":"aeba8075-b0f4-3bdb-a6c0-d48ec02dcd7a","upvotes":27,"downvotes":7,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"RadioHead","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_nl.jpg","author_guid":"NZ5AKCHOTCMNJJU4WZFZ7WELQ4","score":0.77764136861187,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-09064a35-a42f-39f3-932c-8d6391aa23d4_a-aeba8075-b0f4-3bdb-a6c0-d48ec02dcd7a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/could-1987-stock-market-crash-2l3by8e","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/could-1987-stock-market-crash-050919703.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-10-19\/26fd0ef0-b4ad-11e7-af53-c75ba1c80375_GettyImages-827576994.jpg","title":"Could the 1987 stock market crash happen again?","summary":"On the 30th anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash, U.S. stocks are at a record high and investors are concerned that steep valuations may mean a correction is overdue, despite healthy corporate earnings and economic growth.
