Unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the 2010 law in a Congress led by his own party, Trump indicated he would take unilateral action. It would also expand the amount of time people can use short-term medical insurance plans, which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits.","published_at":1507650867,"content_id":"9909b77b-acc5-388f-b0d7-9d42edf6f58c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-says-likely-sign-healthcare-order-week-163535849.html","content_published_at":1507661905,"content_relative_time":23,"vibe_name":"Finance"},"created_at":1507737346,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"He means that he needs more H-1 B workers to come to the US, so he can underpay them while firing all American workers.","id":"e7441011-07d6-4725-ab97-460c2599f22a","context_id":"94f7e069-7b69-33e1-bd22-8e483d6d9654","upvotes":2,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Another User","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_AU_jd.jpg","score":0.47629367141096,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-ed7f9cae-a617-31e3-843d-6c471e462a6e_a-94f7e069-7b69-33e1-bd22-8e483d6d9654","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/paypal-ceo-still-lot-diversity-1v0vd8x","author":"nanook","provider":"Yahoo Finance Video","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/paypal-ceo-still-lot-diversity-181831549.html","img":"http:\/\/d.yimg.com\/hd\/yahoofinance\/1\/8\/c070d3712624ec2b7d2a011ca38102d7_ivXvDL-UOFtXZ2ao_FJ_1nW5auNR0_q6g7VTbLZuoA5yP_cOOwf91Sx_x01u50YJox3nMidlOfw-~A_2_0.jpg?s=94b4c380d57c4fa526c6932d0adb02bf&c=fef5b033d1038fe76b3b2da95285682c&a=yahoofinance&mr=0","title":"PayPal CEO: We still have a lot of work to do with diversity","summary":null,"published_at":1507745911,"content_id":"94f7e069-7b69-33e1-bd22-8e483d6d9654","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/paypal-ceo-still-lot-diversity-181831549.html","content_published_at":1507745911,"content_relative_time":0,"vibe_name":"Finance"},"created_at":1507746997,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"Increasing the occupation is ensuring more deaths.","id":"5db3e7e0-9ffe-4425-9047-988907410506","context_id":"2f464c0c-825d-3dee-a6b5-a5bf8da2d181","upvotes":2,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Ray","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_jd_6-16.jpg","score":0.47629367141096,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-639764a0-1a9b-3023-826f-75d43ee64fbc_a-2f464c0c-825d-3dee-a6b5-a5bf8da2d181","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/israel-advance-plans-nearly-4-000-settler-homes-2hgbr4y","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"AFP","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/israel-advance-plans-nearly-4-000-settler-homes-152258009.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/9fc7d4cea9ce12e8a74131af1663fea3390ef01d.jpg","title":"Israel to advance plans for nearly 4,000 settler homes: official","summary":"Israel is to advance plans for nearly 4,000 settler homes in the occupied West Bank as part of a push to greatly boost settlement growth, an Israeli official said Tuesday.

Back when the majority of new hires were expected to stay with the company for the long haul, traditional orientation programs consisted of a brief introduction to the company and a lot of paperwork. Now, today's new generation of workers is looking for more than just a job and workers are not afraid to job hop until they find the right fit. In a recent survey by Korn Ferry, 90% of executives said retaining new hires is an issue in their company with the majority reporting turnover rates of 10-25% within the first 6 months alone.
