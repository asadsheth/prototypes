Using honest data and calculating data points such as GDP, CPI, UNEMPLOYMENT you see an entirely different picture then the one you are being fed. The US GDP has been negative since 2001 and is currently at -2%, inflation is very high and is currently at 9% and unemployment is the worst at depression era level is currently at 22%.
