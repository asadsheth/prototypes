Yahweh(God) will hold each of us accountable for what we know concerning His Truth. Some people may appear to be more sinful(e.g. lie, steal, murder, unforgiveness, etc.) than others, but we are all born with a rebellious nature towards Yahweh and should not compare ourselves among ourselves concerning sin. We tend to compare ourselves morally to those we view as below us, yet materially we compare ourselves to those we view as above us. Romans 3:23 states: \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of Yahweh.\" Yeshua(Jesus) teaches that just desiring in your heart to commit sin is against Yahweh's Torah(Teaching), which emphasizes \"The Ten Commandments\". The Bible warns in Revelation 20:11-15 that if you reject Yahweh's plan of salvation you will not enter into His Kingdom. That's not Yahweh's desire. 2 Peter 3:9 states: \"The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. Instead He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.\" He sent His Son Yeshua Who lived a sinless life and willingly suffered and died on the cross for you. You broke Yahweh's Torah, but Yeshua paid your fine. That means He can legally dismiss your case. He can commute your \"second death\" sentence---the lake of fire. In John 3:16-17 Yeshua says, \"For Yahweh so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For Yahweh did not send His Son into the world to condemn it, but to save it.\" Then He rose from the dead and defeated death. Please repent (turn from sin) today and trust alone in Yeshua, and Yahweh will grant you the gift of everlasting life. Then read the Bible daily and obey it. In Revelation 21:4 Yahweh promises His people that in His Kingdom \"there will be no more death, mourning, crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\" There is nothing more important than your eternal salvation!","id":"1c9c385b-e4b0-482f-af51-60588fd5dc0b","context_id":"3d3af853-6588-38f6-acec-cdcb15119d6d","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Stephen","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_S_kl.jpg","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-697683bd-3b2a-39ce-9f99-0095b608542f_a-3d3af853-6588-38f6-acec-cdcb15119d6d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/opioid-crisis-hits-record-death-3y36ixg","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Yahoo View","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/opioid-crisis-hits-record-death-154814747.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/es-US\/homerun\/yahoo_view_839\/bd562078be531f160cc2a48f27f660f9","title":"Opioid Crisis Hits Record Death Rate in Ohio Town","summary":"A small Ohio town had set a new record for deaths due to accidental overdose from opioids.

The order would, in effect, exempt many association health plans, groups of small businesses that pool together to buy health insurance, from core Obamacare requirements like the coverage of certain essential health benefits. It would potentially allow individuals to join these plans too, which would put individual insurance marketplaces in serious peril by drawing younger and healthier people away from them. Together, these changes represent a serious threat to Obamacare: President Trump seems ready to open more loopholes for more people to buy insurance outside the health care law's markets, which experts anticipate would destabilize the market for customers who are left behind with higher premiums and fewer insurers.","published_at":1507467650,"content_id":"a341ac99-ac18-3455-8cb0-ba7cb0341b14","content_url":"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/policy-and-politics\/2017\/10\/8\/16439492\/trump-obamacare-association-health-plans","content_published_at":1507438800,"content_relative_time":41,"vibe_name":"Finance"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":41,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-925ee4e1-7f8c-3c5f-8ff4-d69f49e05a1f_a-8354bff9-7a08-3d44-b337-fee2043d1ec9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-925ee4e1-7f8c-3c5f-8ff4-d69f49e05a1f_a-8354bff9-7a08-3d44-b337-fee2043d1ec9","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"New York Post","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/10\/07\/tesla-delays-big-rig-truck-after-musk-blames-production-hell\/","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/glbt.zSEa1trMBkDDixjoA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8354bff9-7a08-3d44-b337-fee2043d1ec9-692914045.jpeg","title":"Tesla delays big rig truck after Musk blames 'production hell\u201d","summary":"Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Friday pushed back the unveiling of the company's big rig truck until mid-November, tweeting that the electric vehicle maker was diverting resources to fix production bottlenecks of its new Model 3 sedan and to help Puerto Rico.
