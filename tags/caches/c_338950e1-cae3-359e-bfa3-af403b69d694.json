to recap - the tax bill will likely involve huge tax breaks mainly to the wealthy and corporations, without significant tax relief for the middle class.

And if it doesn't get rid of tax breaks, but balloons the debt, it will likely be voted against by Rand Paul at the very least.

Repukes have been selling their failed and tested trickle down economics theories to uneducated conservative blue collar voters for decades. It's just more of the same tax cuts for the wealthy. It's also why so many unpatriotic Republi-CANT's are still standing behind the orange toilet tweeting POTUS. They need these tax cuts to make their wealthy donors happy. They promised bigly tax cuts for the rich by repealing Obamacare. But that didn't happen. So they're focusing on tax reform instead. And this one, as expected, does nothing for middle class families. 80% of the benefits go to the top 1% over time. Everyone else is fighting over crumbs. Your typical broke, blue collar Trump supporter will get roughly $700 to buy more of their cheap pee water beer, while the top 1% walk away with milions, and the top 0.1% walk away with billions. Lower corporate tax rates also doesn't equate to more jobs. The owners and shareholders simply pocket the extra money. Rank and file worker bees won't see a dime of it.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who wants opposition support to be able to present a united front in the crisis, has called an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday to pave the way for Madrid establishing central control in the region.","published_at":1508486428,"content_id":"4f8591fc-09b9-3e11-8742-638ce8699c51","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/spanish-government-aims-january-regional-elections-catalonia-psoe-081454789--business.html","content_published_at":1508526821,"content_relative_time":3,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508508556,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":false},{"text":"The act does not go far enough.

The Socialists, the main opposition, said on Friday they would back special measures to impose central rule on the region to thwart the secessionist-minded Catalan government and end a crisis that has unsettled the euro and hurt confidence in the euro zone's fourth-largest economy. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who wants opposition support to be able to present a united front in the crisis, has called an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday to pave the way for Madrid establishing central control in the region.","published_at":1508486428,"content_id":"4f8591fc-09b9-3e11-8742-638ce8699c51","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/spanish-government-aims-january-regional-elections-catalonia-psoe-081454789--business.html","content_published_at":1508526821,"content_relative_time":3,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508505858,"comment_relative_time":9,"bot":false},{"text":"THE MARKETS WILL NOT GO INTO CORRECTIONS AS EARNINGS ARE THERE AND THE INVESTORS HAVE ACCESS TO EASY MONEY.","message_id":"12a0bb10-93f9-42e9-a993-83543363e6d4","context_id":"c9b26884-7445-341f-97cb-430e82b32815","upvotes":0,"downvotes":5,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Big Mama","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_ald.jpg","author_guid":"TZHV56OZXLPD6UJJ46LTX6YUDY","score":0.14106868209062,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-c36b157f-9df8-3f4e-8426-13b4ff9a898b_a-c9b26884-7445-341f-97cb-430e82b32815","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/strategist-jeff-saut-8-bull-2d7ajqj","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"CNBC","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/strategist-jeff-saut-8-old-133107804.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.cnbc2.com\/1c35f843eeb31bbba2fd11debca1be1a","title":"Strategist Jeff Saut: The 8-year-old bull market still has up to nine more years left","summary":"It's not even close to being too late to buy into the second-longest stock bull market in history, says the veteran Wall Street expert.","published_at":1508449093,"content_id":"c9b26884-7445-341f-97cb-430e82b32815","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/strategist-jeff-saut-8-old-133107804.html","content_published_at":1508419867,"content_relative_time":33,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508487515,"comment_relative_time":14,"bot":false},{"text":"HE LOOKS LIKE CRAP WITH HIS FACIAL HAIR, DON'T WEAR A BEARD IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO GROOM!

The deal worked out by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray would meet some Democratic objectives, including reviving the subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans.

The deal worked out by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray would meet some Democratic objectives, including reviving the subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans.

Here are some facts about outsourcing US mfr. to China: in the US : sure, the shoppers at Wal Mart & CostCo got a 10% price cut buying things made in China rather than in the US itself, but Wall St. itself DOUBLED their profit margin, using some of those extra billions they tightened their grip on DC,  our whole political system, and then to distract voters from their takeover funded right wing groups and fomented neo Racism, up to 7 million direct jobs in the manufacturing industries of the Mid West were lost to China with all the collateral damages to those communities including the current Opioid crises among the unemployed whites who have lost hope, the powerful religious minority that controls the US helping the Chinese get influential positions within the US, using the media they control to LIE AND DISTRACT about China's anti US policies from Trade to Defense, and in CHINA : massive transfer of US knowhow and technology all FREE to enable outsourced manufacturing, up to 100 million direct new jobs ( 1\/6 th of total employment in China ) created to assemble everything from Nikes to iPhones, being allowed by Wall St and the venal US politicians under their control to run up a Trade Surplus of $ 350 billion a year with the US for the last 20 years, using this Bonanza to fund anti US policies starting from expanding and modernizing the PLA, backing & financing anti democratic regimes in the Third World even E.

Both sites published the story of the man, Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of arson in Sonoma, southeast of Santa Rosa. The websites cite\u00a0a Santa Rosa Press Democrat report, though the paper doesn't connect the arrest to the larger fires, which broke out Oct. 8 in Napa and Sonoma counties and have so far killed dozens and destroyed thousands of homes. Three Sonoma County Probation Officers patrolling the area because of the larger fires spotted Gonzalez, who told them he'd started the fire because he was cold, Sonoma County Sheriff's Sgt.
