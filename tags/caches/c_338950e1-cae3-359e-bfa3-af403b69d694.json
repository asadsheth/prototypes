The BLS has been caught this time red handed falsifying the data on their own spreadsheets. Table B-3 shows the components of wage growth. Entries clearly show a DECLINE in wages month over month but the total line shows an increase? This is not possible. They lied. Again. Data coming from US corporations and the US government are consistently altered to show results that lead the public to believe the economy is doing well when, in fact, it is doing terrible. Using honest data and calculating data points such as GDP, CPI, UNEMPLOYMENT you see an entirely different picture then the one you are being fed. The US GDP has been negative since 2001 and is currently at -2%, inflation is very high and is currently at 9% and unemployment is the worst at depression era level is currently at 22%.

A Tesla Model 3 has appeared in a Craigslist post from Monterey, California. The car allegedly has about 2,000 miles on the odometer. As with every other Model 3 in production, it's a long-range version with the 310-mile battery, and other features include the panoramic glass roof, upgraded sound system and \"Aero\" wheels. The seller notes that \"a unique circumstance\" spurred the for-sale posting. It's currently listed for $150,000, or approximately 3 times the car's initial cost.
