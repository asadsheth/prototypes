(It also helped that he was willing to say things about Obama that no other Republican politician would.) Every move Obama had made since winning in 2008 was not just wrong to Trump's mind, but -- and this is super-important -- un-American. Obama didn't understand what made America the single greatest nation in the world (faith in its people and the free market). Trump did. Trump also grasped early on that the symbolic center of Obama-ism -- the thing that conservatives hated most -- was Obamacare. It was the classic liberal solution: Put the federal government at the center","published_at":1507932015,"content_id":"4b434e33-e319-3b12-b921-ebf3d50b4cf7","content_url":"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/13\/politics\/trump-obamacare-subsidies\/index.html","content_published_at":1507899291,"content_relative_time":10,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e"},{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-3b704c3f-6a76-3beb-87a1-0a1c4dd15bf5_a-a1f65a46-6303-323c-8c80-47a69178c3ac","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/trumpcare-sabotage-2-trumps-executive-5bqfeq1","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"latimes.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/hiltzik\/la-fi-hiltzik-trump-executive-order-obamacare-20171013-story.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/S5Zrw4sPcBApSzRImQRsDg--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9OTAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a1f65a46-6303-323c-8c80-47a69178c3ac--1824760762.jpeg","title":"Trumpcare Sabotage 2: Trump's executive order will undermine Obamacare, but not the way you think","summary":"President Trump turned his sabotage of the Affordable Care Act up to top volume Thursday, chiefly by issuing an executive order instructing three major federal agencies to look into ways to siphon healthy people out of the ACA exchanges. Combined with a second order ending federal payments to insurers to cover deductibles and co-pays for low-income households, the executive order marked a black day for the American healthcare system. The executive order in particular could do major damage to the healthcare market \u2014 but not in the way that many people anticipate. If fully implemented, it's true, the order is likely to lead to higher premiums in the future for hundreds of thousands of Americans","published_at":1507915570,"content_id":"a1f65a46-6303-323c-8c80-47a69178c3ac","content_url":"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/hiltzik\/la-fi-hiltzik-trump-executive-order-obamacare-20171013-story.html","content_published_at":1507928100,"content_relative_time":2,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e"},{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-a6633fab-7088-3b13-8f6d-830dec6935ba_a-cd0b0b34-c375-3f86-bee1-115fe1f8f119","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-a6633fab-7088-3b13-8f6d-830dec6935ba_a-cd0b0b34-c375-3f86-bee1-115fe1f8f119","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"CNN","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/12\/politics\/trump-obamacare-executive-order\/index.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kJ0TklurLTmtqyXRsY5wCg--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NjE5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cd0b0b34-c375-3f86-bee1-115fe1f8f119-1260034256.jpeg","title":"Trump begins Obamacare dismantling with executive order","summary":"Specifically, the President is directing the Labor Department to study how to make it easier for small businesses, and possibly individuals, to join together and buy health insurance through nationwide association health plans. The department could give employers in the same industries more flexibility to offer group coverage across state lines, providing them with a broader range of policies at lower rates. Separately, the order would allow consumers to buy short-term policies, which don't have to comply with Obamacare's protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Also, it looks to broaden the ability of employers to give workers money to buy their own coverage through health reimbursement","published_at":1507903458,"content_id":"cd0b0b34-c375-3f86-bee1-115fe1f8f119","content_url":"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/12\/politics\/trump-obamacare-executive-order\/index.html","content_published_at":1507819622,"content_relative_time":32,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e"},{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-e2629e3b-8f0e-3e5e-9dba-947e5332c9bd_a-89b23556-f5b4-312f-8d9e-2fd9f4ddf25a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/trump-just-made-move-could-5335aoj","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Business Insider","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-just-made-move-could-135400912.html","img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/Finance\/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE\/Trump_just_made_a_move-feecd0ed459b07f62514daf9a66b85d8","title":"Trump just made a move that could make Obamacare implode \u2014 here's which states have the most to lose","summary":"The Trump administration made a decision that could help the Affordable Care Act implode.
