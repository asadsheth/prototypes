Stymied in Congress by the failure of Senate Republicans to pass legislation to dismantle Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, Trump's order marks his administration's latest effort to undermine the law without action by lawmakers. Trump's order was his most concrete step to undo Obamacare since he took office in January after promising voters he would dismantle the 2010 law.","published_at":1507812999,"content_id":"5eab9209-ee70-3abb-8f8d-f93898f03626","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-order-roll-back-obamacare-requirements-white-house-143149855--business.html","content_published_at":1507825426,"content_relative_time":0,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform"},{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-af356cb9-94ce-3b40-9066-5d952c1bf7c8_a-34beb519-f239-36a7-98ea-c03f86cc6255","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/gov-snyder-defends-medicaid-expansion-9dws2vf","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Detroit Free Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.freep.com\/story\/news\/local\/michigan\/2017\/10\/12\/snyder-defends-medicaid-expansion\/755917001\/","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/HGaZRERMxnweGQcCTRmYLQ--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_34beb519-f239-36a7-98ea-c03f86cc6255--638093654.jpeg","title":"Gov.
