The fire broke out at approximately 3:45 a.m. on 216th Street, just north of Glover Road. When firefighters arrived, they found flames pouring from building on the property. Initial reports suggested that agricultural buildings were also damaged, but officials said it was actually a massive garage. The two-alarm fire leveled the building, which held about 40 collector vehicles. An estimate of the cost of damage has not yet been provided.

The alarming pace of destruction -- 51 percent higher than the prior year with a loss of 73.4 million acres (29.7 million hectares), according to data from the University of Maryland -- was partially due to climate change that has increased the risks and intensity of wildfires by triggering temperature rise and drought in some places, the monitor said.
