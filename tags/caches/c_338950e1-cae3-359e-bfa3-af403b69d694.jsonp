The order would, in effect, exempt many association health plans, groups of small businesses that pool together to buy health insurance, from core Obamacare requirements like the coverage of certain essential health benefits. It would potentially allow individuals to join these plans too, which would put individual insurance marketplaces in serious peril by drawing younger and healthier people away from them. Together, these changes represent a serious threat to Obamacare: President Trump seems ready to open more loopholes for more people to buy insurance outside the health care law's markets, which experts anticipate would destabilize the market for customers who are left behind with higher premiums and fewer insurers.","published_at":1507467650,"content_id":"a341ac99-ac18-3455-8cb0-ba7cb0341b14","content_url":"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/policy-and-politics\/2017\/10\/8\/16439492\/trump-obamacare-association-health-plans","content_published_at":1507438800,"content_relative_time":41,"vibe_name":"Finance"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":41,"bot":true}]);
