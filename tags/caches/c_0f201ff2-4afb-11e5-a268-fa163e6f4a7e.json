Features reclaimed or created from land which appear above water when low tide and submerged in water when high tide do have 500 meters of safety water around them. However, the UNCLOS short of telling us whether these features have sovereignty or not. When we say features created from low tide elevations, we mean these creatures are located in a coastal country's Exclusive Economic Zone. It is not any feature created in the high seas, as most ignorant commentators displayed their dotard IQ here. China's reclamation of islands in the South China Sea appear to be within the context of the UNCLOS. There are two groups of reclaimed features by China. One group is island reclaimed from high tide elevations. This group of islands certainly has 12 nautical miles of sovereignty waters. Another group of islands is created from low tide elevations. These islands may or may not have 12 nm of territorial seas. If this group of islands is located with the 12 nm of territorial seas of another island or groups of islands, certainly these island also are entitled to have territorial seas. Both the Chinese and the Americans know this very well. My though is that Americans may not even care about this part of the international law, but China does. On the other hand, China is not in a hurry to make a big fuss of it. China may be just interested in collecting more data\/information about any American ship that passes around these islands. I believe that China might have submerged systems to collect data from ships that pass by. These could be data collection systems or some may well be weapons. So, who will laugh in the final second is hard to say now.","id":"581d510d-280c-4c9e-aba9-1384f22fbd71","context_id":"a23cdd30-62ce-3128-922b-630275134ef3","upvotes":1,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Eric","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_E_kl_2_6-16.jpg","score":0.3395700843609,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-5e3a5a0d-a78e-34b6-ae3e-cb7dc3bdcfa6_a-a23cdd30-62ce-3128-922b-630275134ef3","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/exclusive-u-warship-sails-near-islands-beijing-claims-1t7pfot","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/exclusive-u-warship-sails-near-islands-beijing-claims-080234345.html","img":null,"title":"Exclusive: U.S. warship sails near islands Beijing claims in South China Sea - U.S. officials","summary":"By Idrees Ali WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea on Tuesday, three U.S. officials told Reuters, prompting anger in Beijing, even as President Donald Trump's administration seeks Chinese cooperation in reining in North Korea's missile and nuclear programs.
