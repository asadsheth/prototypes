Blackout bombs were first used by the United States in Iraq in the 1990 Gulf War and work by releasing a cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over electrical components. The filaments are so fine that they act like a cloud, but cause short circuits in electrical equipment. South Korea is actively looking to increase its defensive capabilities against the North and has been keen to develop graphite bombs because they are not lethal to civilians in surrounding areas. The weapons have been developed by South Korea's Agency for Defence Development, Yonhap news agency reported, as one element of the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike programme. \"All technologies for the development of a graphite bomb led by the ADD have been secured\", a military official said. \"It is at the stage where we can build the bombs at any time\". South Korea flexes its military muscle after Norths nuclear test South Korea is bringing forward the deployment of its \"three pillars\" of national defence by as much as three years as a result of the growing threat posed by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development programmes. The three-pronged strategy was originally scheduled to be in place by the mid-2020s, but North Korea's increasingly aggressive and unpredictable behaviour has forced Seoul to revise that timeline. The Kill Chain programme is designed to detect, identify and intercept incoming missiles in the shortest possible time and operates in conjunction with the Korea Air and Missile Defence system for lower-tier defence against inbound missiles. The final component of the strategy is the Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation plan, under which Seoul will launch attacks against leadership targets in North Korea if it detects signs that the regime is planning to use nuclear weapons. Graphite bombs worked well against targets in Iraq, knocking out around 85 percent of the electrical supply across the country. NATO used similar weapons against targets in Serbia in May 1999, damaging around 70 percent of the country's electrical supply. Analysts believe the weapons would work well against targets in North Korea, which are likely to be obsolete and not insulated.","published_at":1507523414,"content_id":"629d6357-e0fd-316b-8ace-1c014e1e774f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/south-korea-developing-graphite-apos-042747380.html","content_published_at":1507523267,"content_relative_time":17,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions"},"created_at":1507547665,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":false},{"text":"What the hell are we getting involved for?","id":"5a17f6f9-2e98-475b-b766-a5a6f63a5b42","context_id":"76ee3f34-f516-30bf-92a0-0e023d2e0b84","upvotes":451,"downvotes":29,"reports":0,"replies":45,"author_name":"Staffy","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_S_kl.jpg","score":0.94334942770405,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-3e3ceb89-ab42-36b6-8d13-caebfe901c49_a-76ee3f34-f516-30bf-92a0-0e023d2e0b84","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-3e3ceb89-ab42-36b6-8d13-caebfe901c49_a-76ee3f34-f516-30bf-92a0-0e023d2e0b84","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/britain-apos-prepares-war-north-031737023.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/663937cc0c889dae41537ab185a20e3d","title":"Britain 'draws up battle plan for war with North Korea'","summary":"Britain 'draws up battle plan for war with North Korea'","published_at":1507519057,"content_id":"76ee3f34-f516-30bf-92a0-0e023d2e0b84","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/britain-apos-prepares-war-north-031737023.html","content_published_at":1507576522,"content_relative_time":2,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions"},"created_at":1507529706,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":false},{"text":"Love how they hate us so much, but use our equipment lol","id":"41a3a73d-fb0c-41a2-a68d-977eb2e805fb","context_id":"2836e12f-b704-3256-8d19-296906db1f80","upvotes":60,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"JG.24","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/77f0a52959ccdc82a83074c3b9443bc2_192.jpeg","score":0.93431005407879,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-efeff632-9abd-3ed6-a737-7d505ddbdf62_a-2836e12f-b704-3256-8d19-296906db1f80","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/north-korea-smuggled-87-u-4sfpm7s","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The National Interest","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-smuggled-87-u-015700518.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_national_interest_705\/fd56408551c5f9cfa4234fcd0ca71093","title":"This Is How North Korea Smuggled In 87 U.S. Scout Helicopters","summary":"On July 27, 2013, as a column of armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled before the stand of Kim Jong-un to commemorate the end of a bloody war with the United States sixty years earlier, four small American-made MD 500E helicopters buzzed low overhead.

Blackout bombs were first used by the United States in Iraq in the 1990 Gulf War and work by releasing a cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over electrical components. The filaments are so fine that they act like a cloud, but cause short circuits in electrical equipment. South Korea is actively looking to increase its defensive capabilities against the North and has been keen to develop graphite bombs because they are not lethal to civilians in surrounding areas. The weapons have been developed by South Korea's Agency for Defence Development, Yonhap news agency reported, as one element of the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike programme. \"All technologies for the development of a graphite bomb led by the ADD have been secured\", a military official said. \"It is at the stage where we can build the bombs at any time\". South Korea flexes its military muscle after Norths nuclear test South Korea is bringing forward the deployment of its \"three pillars\" of national defence by as much as three years as a result of the growing threat posed by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development programmes. The three-pronged strategy was originally scheduled to be in place by the mid-2020s, but North Korea's increasingly aggressive and unpredictable behaviour has forced Seoul to revise that timeline. The Kill Chain programme is designed to detect, identify and intercept incoming missiles in the shortest possible time and operates in conjunction with the Korea Air and Missile Defence system for lower-tier defence against inbound missiles. The final component of the strategy is the Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation plan, under which Seoul will launch attacks against leadership targets in North Korea if it detects signs that the regime is planning to use nuclear weapons. Graphite bombs worked well against targets in Iraq, knocking out around 85 percent of the electrical supply across the country. NATO used similar weapons against targets in Serbia in May 1999, damaging around 70 percent of the country's electrical supply. Analysts believe the weapons would work well against targets in North Korea, which are likely to be obsolete and not insulated.","published_at":1507523414,"content_id":"629d6357-e0fd-316b-8ace-1c014e1e774f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/south-korea-developing-graphite-apos-042747380.html","content_published_at":1507523267,"content_relative_time":17,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions"},"created_at":1507547665,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":false},{"text":"So what, they have 30 year old helicopters that the US knows inside and out.","id":"68cbb8f5-5e0f-44f5-8305-3d32df9510f2","context_id":"2836e12f-b704-3256-8d19-296906db1f80","upvotes":76,"downvotes":7,"reports":0,"replies":6,"author_name":"JG.24","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/77f0a52959ccdc82a83074c3b9443bc2_192.jpeg","score":0.90390028435413,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-efeff632-9abd-3ed6-a737-7d505ddbdf62_a-2836e12f-b704-3256-8d19-296906db1f80","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/north-korea-smuggled-87-u-4sfpm7s","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The National Interest","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-smuggled-87-u-015700518.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_national_interest_705\/fd56408551c5f9cfa4234fcd0ca71093","title":"This Is How North Korea Smuggled In 87 U.S. Scout Helicopters","summary":"On July 27, 2013, as a column of armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled before the stand of Kim Jong-un to commemorate the end of a bloody war with the United States sixty years earlier, four small American-made MD 500E helicopters buzzed low overhead.

Blackout bombs were first used by the United States in Iraq in the 1990 Gulf War and work by releasing a cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over electrical components. The filaments are so fine that they act like a cloud, but cause short circuits in electrical equipment. South Korea is actively looking to increase its defensive capabilities against the North and has been keen to develop graphite bombs because they are not lethal to civilians in surrounding areas. The weapons have been developed by South Korea's Agency for Defence Development, Yonhap news agency reported, as one element of the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike programme. \"All technologies for the development of a graphite bomb led by the ADD have been secured\", a military official said. \"It is at the stage where we can build the bombs at any time\". South Korea flexes its military muscle after Norths nuclear test South Korea is bringing forward the deployment of its \"three pillars\" of national defence by as much as three years as a result of the growing threat posed by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development programmes. The three-pronged strategy was originally scheduled to be in place by the mid-2020s, but North Korea's increasingly aggressive and unpredictable behaviour has forced Seoul to revise that timeline. The Kill Chain programme is designed to detect, identify and intercept incoming missiles in the shortest possible time and operates in conjunction with the Korea Air and Missile Defence system for lower-tier defence against inbound missiles. The final component of the strategy is the Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation plan, under which Seoul will launch attacks against leadership targets in North Korea if it detects signs that the regime is planning to use nuclear weapons. Graphite bombs worked well against targets in Iraq, knocking out around 85 percent of the electrical supply across the country. NATO used similar weapons against targets in Serbia in May 1999, damaging around 70 percent of the country's electrical supply. Analysts believe the weapons would work well against targets in North Korea, which are likely to be obsolete and not insulated.","published_at":1507523414,"content_id":"629d6357-e0fd-316b-8ace-1c014e1e774f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/south-korea-developing-graphite-apos-042747380.html","content_published_at":1507523267,"content_relative_time":17,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions"},"created_at":1507547665,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":false},{"text":"So, why doesn't the CIA sent a team in to whack the guys who set this up?","id":"5d44cc1b-22f7-450e-bf65-111cc2a55b85","context_id":"2836e12f-b704-3256-8d19-296906db1f80","upvotes":57,"downvotes":9,"reports":0,"replies":7,"author_name":"JG.24","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/77f0a52959ccdc82a83074c3b9443bc2_192.jpeg","score":0.85618617963995,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-efeff632-9abd-3ed6-a737-7d505ddbdf62_a-2836e12f-b704-3256-8d19-296906db1f80","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/north-korea-smuggled-87-u-4sfpm7s","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The National Interest","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-smuggled-87-u-015700518.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_national_interest_705\/fd56408551c5f9cfa4234fcd0ca71093","title":"This Is How North Korea Smuggled In 87 U.S. Scout Helicopters","summary":"On July 27, 2013, as a column of armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled before the stand of Kim Jong-un to commemorate the end of a bloody war with the United States sixty years earlier, four small American-made MD 500E helicopters buzzed low overhead.

Blackout bombs were first used by the United States in Iraq in the 1990 Gulf War and work by releasing a cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over electrical components. The filaments are so fine that they act like a cloud, but cause short circuits in electrical equipment. South Korea is actively looking to increase its defensive capabilities against the North and has been keen to develop graphite bombs because they are not lethal to civilians in surrounding areas. The weapons have been developed by South Korea's Agency for Defence Development, Yonhap news agency reported, as one element of the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike programme. \"All technologies for the development of a graphite bomb led by the ADD have been secured\", a military official said. \"It is at the stage where we can build the bombs at any time\". South Korea flexes its military muscle after Norths nuclear test South Korea is bringing forward the deployment of its \"three pillars\" of national defence by as much as three years as a result of the growing threat posed by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development programmes. The three-pronged strategy was originally scheduled to be in place by the mid-2020s, but North Korea's increasingly aggressive and unpredictable behaviour has forced Seoul to revise that timeline. The Kill Chain programme is designed to detect, identify and intercept incoming missiles in the shortest possible time and operates in conjunction with the Korea Air and Missile Defence system for lower-tier defence against inbound missiles. The final component of the strategy is the Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation plan, under which Seoul will launch attacks against leadership targets in North Korea if it detects signs that the regime is planning to use nuclear weapons. Graphite bombs worked well against targets in Iraq, knocking out around 85 percent of the electrical supply across the country.

South Korea is actively looking to increase its defensive capabilities against the North and has been keen to develop graphite bombs because they are not lethal to civilians in surrounding areas.

The final component of the strategy is the Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation plan, under which Seoul will launch attacks against leadership targets in North Korea if it detects signs that the regime is planning to use nuclear weapons.

Blackout bombs were first used by the United States in Iraq in the 1990 Gulf War and work by releasing a cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over electrical components. The filaments are so fine that they act like a cloud, but cause short circuits in electrical equipment. South Korea is actively looking to increase its defensive capabilities against the North and has been keen to develop graphite bombs because they are not lethal to civilians in surrounding areas. The weapons have been developed by South Korea's Agency for Defence Development, Yonhap news agency reported, as one element of the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike programme. \"All technologies for the development of a graphite bomb led by the ADD have been secured\", a military official said. \"It is at the stage where we can build the bombs at any time\". South Korea flexes its military muscle after Norths nuclear test South Korea is bringing forward the deployment of its \"three pillars\" of national defence by as much as three years as a result of the growing threat posed by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development programmes. The three-pronged strategy was originally scheduled to be in place by the mid-2020s, but North Korea's increasingly aggressive and unpredictable behaviour has forced Seoul to revise that timeline. The Kill Chain programme is designed to detect, identify and intercept incoming missiles in the shortest possible time and operates in conjunction with the Korea Air and Missile Defence system for lower-tier defence against inbound missiles. The final component of the strategy is the Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation plan, under which Seoul will launch attacks against leadership targets in North Korea if it detects signs that the regime is planning to use nuclear weapons. Graphite bombs worked well against targets in Iraq, knocking out around 85 percent of the electrical supply across the country. NATO used similar weapons against targets in Serbia in May 1999, damaging around 70 percent of the country's electrical supply. Analysts believe the weapons would work well against targets in North Korea, which are likely to be obsolete and not insulated.","published_at":1507523414,"content_id":"629d6357-e0fd-316b-8ace-1c014e1e774f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/south-korea-developing-graphite-apos-042747380.html","content_published_at":1507523267,"content_relative_time":17,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions"},"created_at":1507547665,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":false},{"text":"just get trump to tweet north korea about how good are American helicopters are that even north korea uses them and kim will destroy the helicopters.","id":"48152902-1c31-4c13-b603-55e44ffa3bc9","context_id":"2836e12f-b704-3256-8d19-296906db1f80","upvotes":8,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"JG.24","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/77f0a52959ccdc82a83074c3b9443bc2_192.jpeg","score":0.76589157340432,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-efeff632-9abd-3ed6-a737-7d505ddbdf62_a-2836e12f-b704-3256-8d19-296906db1f80","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/north-korea-smuggled-87-u-4sfpm7s","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The National Interest","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-smuggled-87-u-015700518.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_national_interest_705\/fd56408551c5f9cfa4234fcd0ca71093","title":"This Is How North Korea Smuggled In 87 U.S. Scout Helicopters","summary":"On July 27, 2013, as a column of armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled before the stand of Kim Jong-un to commemorate the end of a bloody war with the United States sixty years earlier, four small American-made MD 500E helicopters buzzed low overhead.

Blackout bombs were first used by the United States in Iraq in the 1990 Gulf War and work by releasing a cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over electrical components. The filaments are so fine that they act like a cloud, but cause short circuits in electrical equipment. South Korea is actively looking to increase its defensive capabilities against the North and has been keen to develop graphite bombs because they are not lethal to civilians in surrounding areas. The weapons have been developed by South Korea's Agency for Defence Development, Yonhap news agency reported, as one element of the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike programme. \"All technologies for the development of a graphite bomb led by the ADD have been secured\", a military official said. \"It is at the stage where we can build the bombs at any time\". South Korea flexes its military muscle after Norths nuclear test South Korea is bringing forward the deployment of its \"three pillars\" of national defence by as much as three years as a result of the growing threat posed by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development programmes. The three-pronged strategy was originally scheduled to be in place by the mid-2020s, but North Korea's increasingly aggressive and unpredictable behaviour has forced Seoul to revise that timeline. The Kill Chain programme is designed to detect, identify and intercept incoming missiles in the shortest possible time and operates in conjunction with the Korea Air and Missile Defence system for lower-tier defence against inbound missiles. The final component of the strategy is the Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation plan, under which Seoul will launch attacks against leadership targets in North Korea if it detects signs that the regime is planning to use nuclear weapons. Graphite bombs worked well against targets in Iraq, knocking out around 85 percent of the electrical supply across the country. NATO used similar weapons against targets in Serbia in May 1999, damaging around 70 percent of the country's electrical supply. Analysts believe the weapons would work well against targets in North Korea, which are likely to be obsolete and not insulated.","published_at":1507523414,"content_id":"629d6357-e0fd-316b-8ace-1c014e1e774f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/south-korea-developing-graphite-apos-042747380.html","content_published_at":1507523267,"content_relative_time":17,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions"},"created_at":1507547665,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":false},{"text":"Number one is was not a stunt you morons, our flag was disrespected but a bunch of low lives--no reason to stand there and be ok with it, that is his and our choice--bottom line is $250,000 is all the NFL wishes it was loosing, but in the long run they are realizing that country is more important than the NFL---boy they never thought that was possible--that is how stupid the left is!!","id":"3ac93f22-4fc0-42a4-8e7b-48021a64ec78","context_id":"a37950df-1f85-3fb2-a5c5-27248324aa2a","upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Mike","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_M_jd_2_6-16.jpg","score":0.59722425808824,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-ce9a43b8-f36b-3145-9da8-46ce2fedd619_a-a37950df-1f85-3fb2-a5c5-27248324aa2a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-ce9a43b8-f36b-3145-9da8-46ce2fedd619_a-a37950df-1f85-3fb2-a5c5-27248324aa2a","author":"nanook","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/trump-pence-colts-vs-49ers-105317422.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/4e071045ae4b0277ec71e596b4b2e5fc","title":"Trump and Pence\u2019s Colts vs. 49ers Protest Cost Nearly $250,000","summary":"Vice President Mike Pence left the NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers early on Sunday night\u2014apparently at President Donald Trump\u2019s bidding\u2014after around a dozen 49ers kneeled during the anthem.

Blackout bombs were first used by the United States in Iraq in the 1990 Gulf War and work by releasing a cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over electrical components. The filaments are so fine that they act like a cloud, but cause short circuits in electrical equipment. South Korea is actively looking to increase its defensive capabilities against the North and has been keen to develop graphite bombs because they are not lethal to civilians in surrounding areas. The weapons have been developed by South Korea's Agency for Defence Development, Yonhap news agency reported, as one element of the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike programme. \"All technologies for the development of a graphite bomb led by the ADD have been secured\", a military official said. \"It is at the stage where we can build the bombs at any time\". South Korea flexes its military muscle after Norths nuclear test South Korea is bringing forward the deployment of its \"three pillars\" of national defence by as much as three years as a result of the growing threat posed by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development programmes. The three-pronged strategy was originally scheduled to be in place by the mid-2020s, but North Korea's increasingly aggressive and unpredictable behaviour has forced Seoul to revise that timeline. The Kill Chain programme is designed to detect, identify and intercept incoming missiles in the shortest possible time and operates in conjunction with the Korea Air and Missile Defence system for lower-tier defence against inbound missiles. The final component of the strategy is the Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation plan, under which Seoul will launch attacks against leadership targets in North Korea if it detects signs that the regime is planning to use nuclear weapons. Graphite bombs worked well against targets in Iraq, knocking out around 85 percent of the electrical supply across the country. NATO used similar weapons against targets in Serbia in May 1999, damaging around 70 percent of the country's electrical supply. Analysts believe the weapons would work well against targets in North Korea, which are likely to be obsolete and not insulated.","published_at":1507523414,"content_id":"629d6357-e0fd-316b-8ace-1c014e1e774f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/south-korea-developing-graphite-apos-042747380.html","content_published_at":1507523267,"content_relative_time":17,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions"},"created_at":1507547665,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":false},{"text":"They only need at the most one bomb!","id":"8dae9b3c-6be2-47a3-a20f-1abb3124f37c","context_id":"629d6357-e0fd-316b-8ace-1c014e1e774f","upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"FightTruthDecay","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_F_kl_6-16.jpg","score":0.52753718344348,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-41d50227-286b-34e9-a0d0-11ccb71e3fb0_a-629d6357-e0fd-316b-8ace-1c014e1e774f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/south-korea-developing-graphite-apos-31nxp5f","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/south-korea-developing-graphite-apos-042747380.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/520b7e2b2e6a5df8969ee95186f988fb","title":"South Korea developing graphite 'blackout bombs' to paralyse North's electrical grid","summary":"South Korea is ready to deploy graphite bombs - also known as \"blackout bombs\" - that will paralyse North Korea's electrical power plants in the event of war breaking out on the peninsula.

Blackout bombs were first used by the United States in Iraq in the 1990 Gulf War and work by releasing a cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over electrical components. The filaments are so fine that they act like a cloud, but cause short circuits in electrical equipment. South Korea is actively looking to increase its defensive capabilities against the North and has been keen to develop graphite bombs because they are not lethal to civilians in surrounding areas. The weapons have been developed by South Korea's Agency for Defence Development, Yonhap news agency reported, as one element of the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike programme. \"All technologies for the development of a graphite bomb led by the ADD have been secured\", a military official said. \"It is at the stage where we can build the bombs at any time\". South Korea flexes its military muscle after Norths nuclear test South Korea is bringing forward the deployment of its \"three pillars\" of national defence by as much as three years as a result of the growing threat posed by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development programmes. The three-pronged strategy was originally scheduled to be in place by the mid-2020s, but North Korea's increasingly aggressive and unpredictable behaviour has forced Seoul to revise that timeline. The Kill Chain programme is designed to detect, identify and intercept incoming missiles in the shortest possible time and operates in conjunction with the Korea Air and Missile Defence system for lower-tier defence against inbound missiles. The final component of the strategy is the Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation plan, under which Seoul will launch attacks against leadership targets in North Korea if it detects signs that the regime is planning to use nuclear weapons. Graphite bombs worked well against targets in Iraq, knocking out around 85 percent of the electrical supply across the country. NATO used similar weapons against targets in Serbia in May 1999, damaging around 70 percent of the country's electrical supply. Analysts believe the weapons would work well against targets in North Korea, which are likely to be obsolete and not insulated.","published_at":1507523414,"content_id":"629d6357-e0fd-316b-8ace-1c014e1e774f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/south-korea-developing-graphite-apos-042747380.html","content_published_at":1507523267,"content_relative_time":17,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions"},"created_at":1507547665,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":false},{"text":"Wonder what a bunch of A10s could do to these sitting on the ground","id":"a90423b9-94a2-4897-8d4d-dcb892ef8d19","context_id":"2836e12f-b704-3256-8d19-296906db1f80","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"JG.24","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/77f0a52959ccdc82a83074c3b9443bc2_192.jpeg","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-efeff632-9abd-3ed6-a737-7d505ddbdf62_a-2836e12f-b704-3256-8d19-296906db1f80","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/north-korea-smuggled-87-u-4sfpm7s","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The National Interest","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-smuggled-87-u-015700518.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_national_interest_705\/fd56408551c5f9cfa4234fcd0ca71093","title":"This Is How North Korea Smuggled In 87 U.S. Scout Helicopters","summary":"On July 27, 2013, as a column of armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled before the stand of Kim Jong-un to commemorate the end of a bloody war with the United States sixty years earlier, four small American-made MD 500E helicopters buzzed low overhead.

Blackout bombs were first used by the United States in Iraq in the 1990 Gulf War and work by releasing a cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over electrical components. The filaments are so fine that they act like a cloud, but cause short circuits in electrical equipment. South Korea is actively looking to increase its defensive capabilities against the North and has been keen to develop graphite bombs because they are not lethal to civilians in surrounding areas. The weapons have been developed by South Korea's Agency for Defence Development, Yonhap news agency reported, as one element of the Kill Chain pre-emptive strike programme. \"All technologies for the development of a graphite bomb led by the ADD have been secured\", a military official said. \"It is at the stage where we can build the bombs at any time\". South Korea flexes its military muscle after Norths nuclear test South Korea is bringing forward the deployment of its \"three pillars\" of national defence by as much as three years as a result of the growing threat posed by Pyongyang's nuclear and missile development programmes. The three-pronged strategy was originally scheduled to be in place by the mid-2020s, but North Korea's increasingly aggressive and unpredictable behaviour has forced Seoul to revise that timeline. The Kill Chain programme is designed to detect, identify and intercept incoming missiles in the shortest possible time and operates in conjunction with the Korea Air and Missile Defence system for lower-tier defence against inbound missiles. The final component of the strategy is the Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation plan, under which Seoul will launch attacks against leadership targets in North Korea if it detects signs that the regime is planning to use nuclear weapons. Graphite bombs worked well against targets in Iraq, knocking out around 85 percent of the electrical supply across the country. NATO used similar weapons against targets in Serbia in May 1999, damaging around 70 percent of the country's electrical supply. Analysts believe the weapons would work well against targets in North Korea, which are likely to be obsolete and not insulated.","published_at":1507523414,"content_id":"629d6357-e0fd-316b-8ace-1c014e1e774f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/south-korea-developing-graphite-apos-042747380.html","content_published_at":1507523267,"content_relative_time":17,"vibe_name":"Korean Tensions"},"created_at":1507547665,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":false},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-2b9ec0ef-464d-394f-a039-e9f8f6c3fd28_a-2921ea13-a295-3e9a-80ba-15f49a763d00","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/two-own-goals-help-world-5kw91me","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"reuters.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/uk-soccer-friendly-rus-kor\/two-own-goals-help-world-cup-hosts-russia-beat-south-korea-idUKKBN1CC0M5","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/uBMiL2U2Nb2QktC.B4RQ1A--\/dz03NDE7aD01NDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2921ea13-a295-3e9a-80ba-15f49a763d00--1813954012.jpeg","title":"Two own goals help World Cup hosts Russia beat South Korea","summary":"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two own goals in three second-half minutes from defender Kim Ju-young helped Russia to a 4-2 win over South Korea in a friendly international in Moscow on Saturday.
