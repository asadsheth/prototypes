It's better to be free and do what is best for one's own nation.","message_id":"32dc3f48-16ce-4649-9610-de5a10bb7c72","context_id":"878eb407-c6c9-35e1-9cc8-3d0d14e4cd0a","upvotes":40,"downvotes":7,"reports":0,"replies":9,"author_name":"Neil","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_N_jl.jpg","author_guid":"QS7CURWI75TS54IW5WNMZ6VAT4","score":0.83516949100434,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-0251b8db-4f33-3d55-b0d2-0daf0b5f7e87_a-878eb407-c6c9-35e1-9cc8-3d0d14e4cd0a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/tillerson-meet-indias-modi-amid-chinas-rising-influence-061629827--finance-47j516q","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/tillerson-meet-indias-modi-amid-chinas-rising-influence-061629827--finance.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2017-10-25T115555Z_1_LYNXMPED9O10P_RTROPTP_2_TILLERSON-ASIA-INDIA.JPG","title":"India defends ties with North Korea in talks with Tillerson","summary":"By Jonathan Landay and Aditya Kalra NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's foreign minister defended the country's ties with North Korea and Iran during talks on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson aimed at building robust relations between the two giant democracies.
