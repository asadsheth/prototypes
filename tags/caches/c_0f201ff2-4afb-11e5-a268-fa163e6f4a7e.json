Iraq was taken out they would not cooperate, and then they threatened to assassinate Bush Senior, Bush Junior was not going to have any of that, so he was taken out. Then the coward Obama pulled out of Iraq which led to the ISIS disaster because the Baath party was removed from holding anymore power in Iraq. whjch now leads us to NK and Iran.  NK is more urgent becasue they are led by a evil regime. Even more that Iran is. plus they now have nukes which is unacceptable to anyone with half a brain. They must either capitualte or be destroyed. Mr. Trump is giving NK time to decide, but time is about to run out. NK will be flattened before Xmas.

It was called the \"Agreed Framework\". In it Pyongyang agreed to limit their nuclear weapons program in exchange for shipments of fuel and a non-weaponize-able nuclear reactor. While there was a missile test in 1998 that triggered some re negotiations, this was a path to peace where both sides were able to sit down.\n\nIn 2002, George W. Bush, against the advice of Colin Powell, pulled us out of the deal. Fuel shipments ceased and Bush began using the \"axis of evil\" label for Kim Jong Il's regime. This damaged relations to the point North Korea believe the US would never honor any agreement they made at the table, understandably so.\n\nNow, we have a Secretary of State who has had open conflict with the President. It is tough for a foreign nation to believe that Tillerson holds the President's ear anymore, and have little incentive to sitting with him to make a deal. We also have a President who has decided to pull out and ignore numerous longstanding deals and negotiations (NAFTA, The Paris Agreement, NATO, TPP, etc)\n\nPulling out of the Iran deal could be the final step to North Korea realizing there will never be any diplomatic relations with the US and the only response will be war.\n\n(Source: https:\/\/www.armscontrol.org\/factsheets\/agreedframework)","message_id":"22d18572-263d-4591-bc53-612fab75316f","context_id":"71d6568d-0d84-391d-8929-76d2bdcc6328","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Mike Stafstrom","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_M_mr.jpg","author_guid":"YQL5FKGJ52JSAF45HXBGDZMBFI","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-17cdf1b0-0460-3862-8ac3-3949d5a23b42_a-71d6568d-0d84-391d-8929-76d2bdcc6328","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/america-could-subdue-north-korea-qbrkiud","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"The National Interest","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/america-could-subdue-north-korea-000900177.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_national_interest_705\/b34dbc360bbb38fb38b3320d72eeea1b","title":"America Could Subdue North Korea's Nuclear Threats with a Not-So-Grand Bargain","summary":"A double-freeze deal will not be satisfying to either U.S. or North Korean leaders, but it still reduces tensions and the risk of accidental nuclear war.

Does anybody recall the trauma that followed 9\/11? The effect that losing a mere 3000 had on us.  The Japanese still bear the psychological wounds of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, even generations later.  And it afflicts the attackers too.  The B29 crews carried their guilt to the grave. There will be a national pall of guilt, shame, or sorrow - depending on the stance we took on war - that will settle over our population, over those that cheered on the US to kill 17 million North Koreans, or silently assented to it.  If there weren't, it would indicate a far worse condition: a people anesthetized to evil, and remorseless. I point this out to those that promote war in Korea.  You will be changed in ways you can't imagine.","message_id":"4a2dbd02-7fd2-41b7-a0b5-0d7c00ab177b","context_id":"71d6568d-0d84-391d-8929-76d2bdcc6328","upvotes":7,"downvotes":8,"reports":0,"replies":4,"author_name":"Steve","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_S_kl.jpg","author_guid":"UAYJFHIHF455YD6U7SNFXBSQYA","score":0.49326883648657,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-0f201ff2-4afb-11e5-a268-fa163e6f4a7e_c-17cdf1b0-0460-3862-8ac3-3949d5a23b42_a-71d6568d-0d84-391d-8929-76d2bdcc6328","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/korean-tensions\/america-could-subdue-north-korea-qbrkiud","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"The National Interest","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/america-could-subdue-north-korea-000900177.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_national_interest_705\/b34dbc360bbb38fb38b3320d72eeea1b","title":"America Could Subdue North Korea's Nuclear Threats with a Not-So-Grand Bargain","summary":"A double-freeze deal will not be satisfying to either U.S. or North Korean leaders, but it still reduces tensions and the risk of accidental nuclear war.
