Austin, Texas, followed suit Thursday. It joined cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, which had previously booted Columbus in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the gesture to recognize indigenous people rather than the man who opened the Americas to European domination also has prompted howls of outrage from some Italian-Americans, who say eliminating their festival of ethnic pride is culturally insensitive, too. \u201cWe had a very difficult time in this country for well over a hundred years,\u201d said Basil Russo, president of the Order Italian Sons and Daughters of America. \u201cColumbus Day is a day that we\u2019ve chosen to celebrate who we are. And we\u2019re entitled to do that just as they are entitled to celebrate who they are.\u201d It\u2019s not about taking anything away from Italian-Americans, said Cliff Matias, cultural director of the Redhawk Native American Arts Council, which hosted a Re-Thinking Columbus Day event Sunday and Monday in New York. \u201cThe conversation is Columbus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to celebrate Columbus, we need to celebrate the fact that we survived Columbus.\u201d The debate over Columbus\u2019 historical legacy is an old one, but it became emotionally charged after a similar debate in the South over monuments to Confederate generals flared into deadly violence in August at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In Akron, Ohio, a September vote over whether to dump Columbus opened a racial rift on the city council that was so heated conflict mediators were brought in to sooth tensions. In New York, where 35,000 people marched in Monday\u2019s Columbus Day parade, vandals last month doused the hands of a Christopher Columbus statue in blood-red paint and scrawled the words \u201chate will not be tolerated.\u201d Activists calling for the city to change the parade\u2019s name also are expected to hold a demonstration. On Sunday, three demonstrators briefly interrupted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Columbus statue in Columbus Circle. Two dressed in fake chains. One wore a hooded white sheet. Police said one person was arrested. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, appointed a committee to evaluate whether monuments to certain historical figures should be removed, prompting a backlash from fellow Italian-Americans who vowed to defend the Columbus statue, which has stood over Columbus Circle for more than a century. But the mayor still marched in Monday\u2019s parade. \u201cYou can debate the historical figure of Christopher Columbus, but you can\u2019t debate the contribution of Italian-Americans to this country,\u201d de Blasio said at the start of the march.
