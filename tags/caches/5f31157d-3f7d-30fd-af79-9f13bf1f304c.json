Taylor Winston risked his life to stay behind and help those injured as bullets rained down from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. He commandeered a truck which he found with the keys still in the ignition at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival to bring victims to a nearby medical centre. \u00a0 The 29-year-old is now set to receive his own free pickup truck after B5Motors, a dealership based in Arizona, tracked him down. Mr Winston, who was honourably discharged after serving in the military from 2006 to 2011, plans to sell his current vehicle and donate the money to victims of the Vegas shooting. \u201cAt B5Motors we have been overwhelmed with the heartbreaking stories coming out of Vegas,\u201d the dealership posted on Facebook. \u201cHe stole a truck to quickly transport the injured to the hospital. We would like to find Taylor and thank him for his bravery by providing him a free truck from B5Motors. \u201cWe are honored to play a role in this full-circle story as now Taylor will be selling his current vehicle and donating those funds to the Vegas victims. \u201cThank you all for helping us find Taylor, we could not have done it without the efforts of our B5 Motors friends on social media.\u201d 50 dead in Las Vegas shooting, in pictures During the shooting, another group of friends set up an emergency triage area to treat those with injuries at the scene.

The U.S. president uploaded a supercut video of the relief efforts in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, a 1984-esque piece of propaganda that's more about receiving the credit for helping, rather than well, actually helping. SEE ALSO: FEMA omits statistics on Puerto Rico hurricane response from website Titled \"What the fake news media will not show you in Puerto Rico,\" the eight-minute video consists of a mishmash of footage from various agencies, ending with Trump shaking people's hands in the four hours that he was there. \"Nobody could have done what I've done for #PuertoRico with so little appreciation. So much work!\" Trump tweeted.\u00a0 Of course, the video comes following criticism of the Trump administration's handling of the disaster \u2014 and handling of paper towels. Namely, criticism comes from San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, whose complaints were rebuffed as \"political noise\" by FEMA administrator Brock Long. Power collapses in San Juan hospital with 4 patients now being transferred out. Have requested support from FEMA. NOTHING! @DavidBegnaud \u2014 Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) October 8, 2017 The death toll following the Category 4 storm on Sept. 20 stands at 36, but is expected to rise as hospitals still struggle almost three weeks after the disaster hit. The island is still largely without basic utilities: Approximately 56.8 percent of its people have drinking water, and a tiny 11.7 percent of people have electricity.\u00a0 But don't worry about all that. Worry about Trump not getting the plaudits that he's so very used to, because that's what he'd want you to do. The biggest tragedy about #PuertoRico is, first and foremost, the lack of appreciation for you. https:\/\/t.co\/EC3XXQ1vO2 \u2014 Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) October 9, 2017 Remarkable narcissism.

It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, once again highlighting America's extreme rate of gun violence. The frequency of this kind of event risks\u00a0anaesthetising us to the number of people who die from shootings in one of the world's most developed nations. The numbers are staggering. 1. The Las Vegas mass shooting wasn't the only mass shooting in America on Sunday While the scale of the attack in Las Vegas on Sunday night is unparalleled, it wasn't the only mass shooting to occur in the US that day. Some 13,000 miles away in Lawrence, just outside the University of Kansas in Kansas, two men and a woman\u00a0were killed and a further two people injured in a mass shooting incident. While none of the three victims were students at the university, all were in their early twenties, with one of the young men recently having become a father,\u00a0according to the local press. Mass shootings in America - defined as an event where at least four people are shot - are now an every day event. The\u00a0Las Vegas attack makes\u00a0October the most deadly month for mass shootings this year - although not by as much as some may think, given the scale of the atrocity. The scale of US mass shootings in 2017 2. One major mass shooting every two months This year's deaths follow a depressing trend, according to data gathered by the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive. Some 346 people are estimated to have been killed in American mass shootings this year. This compared to 432 in 2016, and 369 in 2015 - more than one person for every day of the year. When it comes to major\u00a0mass shootings (where more than four people are killed), there have been an average of just 72 days between events during the period of 2010 to 2017 . This is a far more frequent rate when compared to the average gap of 162 days from 2000 to 2010, according to data compiled by Mother Jones. The two worst mass shooting events - this week's Las Vegas shooting and the Pulse nightclub atrocity in Orlando - have occurred in the last two years. More than a person a day have been killed in US mass shootings in recent years 3.\u00a0Firearms sales go up after mass shootings Data from the\u00a0FBI\u00a0shows us that there have been 270million firearms background checks since November 1998 - and the number is increasing as time goes by. Such background checks, initiated through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), do not represent the number of firearms sold - but they do give us an idea as to interest in buying guns across the country. In an alarming pattern identified by the\u00a0New York Times, the fear of firearms restrictions is a significant driver of gun sales - with mass shootings and other attacks being another, although to a lesser extent. For example, December 2015 saw the highest number of background checks to date - at 3.3m. This followed the\u00a0San Bernardino terror attack\u00a0in November, in which 14 people died and after which Obama called for tighter restrictions on the purchase of assault rifles. Firearm checks peak after attacks and potential restrictions 4. 270m guns for 320m people In 2007, the Small Arms Survey estimated that there were between 250m and 290m civilian-owned firearms in the US - a rate of around 90 per 100 people. This was the highest rate of civilian guns for any of the 178 countries that were surveyed and was ahead of Yemen (55 guns per 100 civilians) in second place by quite some distance. Higher rates of gun ownership correlate strongly with occurrences of mass shootings with the US emerging\u00a0at the top of tree when it came to mass shootings per head in a study by Jaclyn Schildkraut of the\u00a0State University of New York.\u00a0 Countries with more guns have more mass shootings 5. Mass shootings are just the tip of the iceberg Between 2001 and 2013, 406,496 people died as a result of gun violence in America according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Of this number the majority - 237,052 - were actually suicides as opposed to homicides. Homicides accounted for 153,144 deaths over this period while the rest comprised 8,383 accidental deaths, 4,778 deaths from police shootings and 3,200 where the cause couldn't be determined.\u00a0 In this context, mass shootings make up a comparatively small proportion of overall gun deaths in the US, accounting for around three per cent of homicides in 2017 so far according to the Gun Violence Archive. Suicides account for most US gun deaths 6. Texas is often at the frontline of mass shootings In 2015, there were 45 deaths from\u00a0Texan mass shootings. In 2016, the state saw 39 victims. This year, the running total is 28. While individual large tragedies may skew the data for particular years, Texas is consistently bad for gun violence. After the Las Vegas attack, Nevada has suffered the most deaths from mass shootings this year - at 59 deaths - but it is also top when we make the number proportional to a state's population. It being a small state, Nevada has now had 20 mass shooting deaths per one million of its people - with the next highest rates seen in Mississippi (7.4 per million) and Kansas (3.4 per million). Map: America\u2019s mass shootings hotspots 7. Americans can't agree on gun control The debate over gun rights and restrictions is not a new one in America - and it's opened up every time another mass shooting catches the public's attention.\u00a0 The latest polling from the\u00a0Pew Research Centre\u00a0shows that 47 per cent of Americans support protecting gun rights - compared to 51 per cent who support gun control (6 April 2017). This polling has tightened over the last two decades - when 65 per cent were in favour of gun control in May 1999 - ensuring that the debate continues to rage on. The gun debate is anything but settled At the end of 2016, The Telegraph published a piece called \"The face of America's gun problem\" which aimed to\u00a0document all 432 victims of American mass shootings in 2016.","published_at":1507519247,"content_id":"4e8c0637-b84b-395d-b695-f6cbda9c62a1","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/one-mass-shooting-every-day-112203494.html","content_published_at":1507533464,"content_relative_time":14,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture"},{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-0a1a15a2-bcdd-3963-944b-cc43cd983b22_a-765e22f8-c506-3330-9b09-bec1750bedd9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/protesters-outraged-over-deadly-police-shooting-utah-021713143--abc-news-topstories-5jp5zm2","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Good Morning America","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/protesters-outraged-over-deadly-police-shooting-utah-021713143--abc-news-topstories.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.abcnewsplus.com\/c8d074775f62889615ee48ba8333c408","title":"Protesters outraged over deadly police shooting in Utah","summary":"Black Lives Matter demonstrators gathered outside police headquarters in Salt Lake City this afternoon to protest a prosecutor's decision not to file charges against a police officer who fatally shot a 50-year-old man.

As Roman Catholic priests are bound to a vow of celibacy, the order offered him a \u201cperiod of reflection,\u201d and then in August appointed a substitute rector. \u00a0 The Legion revealed this week that Father\u00a0Turrion told authorities in a letter he had decided to leave the ministry after admitting that his infant daughter is in fact the second child he fathered with a woman he fell in love with several years ago when the order was going through a period of turmoil. He kept the first-born child, a son reportedly born eight years ago, and the ongoing relationship with the child\u2019s mother, a closely guarded secret for years, including during the period he was being considered for rector. In a letter released by the Legion, Turrion asked for prayers and \"foregiveness for the scandal . . for my bad example.\"\u00a0 Popular and passionate about football, \u00a0Father\u00a0Turrion was one of the few ordained priests invited each year to join the seminarians on the field in the Clericus Cup, an annual football tournament between teams from the Rome seminary colleges. The shock revelation has rattled the institution, which said in a statement it was saddened and \"conscious of the impact that the negative example\" had set to\u00a0seminarians and the\u00a0Christian\u00a0faithful. The order faced a similar scandal in\u00a02013, when American priest Thomas Williams, a professor of moral theology at the Legion\u2019s university in Rome and a prominent TV commentator, also announced he would leave the priesthood after admitting he had fathered a child. And in 2006 the Vatican sentenced its founder, Mexican Father\u00a0Marcial Maciel Delgollado to a life of \u201cprayer and penance\u201d after discovering he had sexually abused seminarians and fathered at least three children out of wedlock.\u00a0 Today, the subject of how to manage priests secretly fathering children is gradually becoming less taboo inside the Vatican, thanks in part to the persistent efforts of Vincent Doyle, an Irish Catholic psychotherapist who discovered that his father had been a priest and went on to found the Coping International support group for children of priests, who he said often face emotional, psychological and financial difficulties after years of living with \u201cguilty secrets.\"\u00a0 Earlier this year Irish Catholic bishops passed new guidelines for \u201cthe principles of responsibility regarding priests who father children while in the ministry,\u201d urging the wellbeing of the child to be put first, personally, legally and financially. \u00a0\u00a0","published_at":1507472012,"content_id":"514e475b-ebe5-3d31-aabd-bb1729807cd2","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/senior-catholic-cleric-resigns-secret-140905538.html","content_published_at":1507471745,"content_relative_time":31,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture"},{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-8c6850fd-6653-303f-967e-64634a7857c0_a-7a504019-7e99-3306-a34a-0a0dab2dc345","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/indigenous-peoples-day-italians-stick-columbus-4yhvte6","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/indigenous-peoples-day-italians-stick-columbus-140851002.html","img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/images\/US_AHTTP_AP_NEWSBRIEFS\/f8aeff212f3b42778f955d3325a48a71_original.jpg","title":"Indigenous Peoples Day?
