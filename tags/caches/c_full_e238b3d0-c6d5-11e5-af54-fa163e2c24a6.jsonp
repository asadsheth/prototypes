Congress fell for it. They work if the market does well, however if it does not, they are a total failure. Hence in one's lifetime career, any gains made during a good market can be wiped out in a bad market. I can think of three lately: the crashes in 1987, 2000 and 2008. In order words, they cannot be relied on for retirement. A better way and reliable way is Guaranteed Retirement Accounts (GRA) that would supplement Social Security. 401(k)'s would still be available, if you want to take a chance of losing your retirement savings. I really like these headlines of how much the market has gained since its low in 2009 until now. Very impressive. Yet the headlines always leave out how much the market has gained from its high just preceding 2009. A much different story. The reality is if you were nearing retirement in 2009, you probably lost much of your 401(k), leaving little or none to rely on in retirement. Most folks therefore will be working well into their 70's or even 80's to make up what was lost, and no 401(k) plan is going to do them any good at all. However for folks just starting out they are probably thinking 401(k) plan is pretty good - but look out folks, we live in a boom bust economy, and the day of a bust and a crash will be inevitable and there goes all of your gains and even some or all of your contributions. Best advice: convince congress to set up Guaranteed Retirement Accounts, and forget 401(K)'s.","message_id":"d013e770-393f-4e94-8bc2-e9bef62dc36e","context_id":"c1b93974-9b89-3100-b87e-11e05c5fcffa","upvotes":19,"downvotes":4,"reports":0,"replies":6,"author_name":"Savvy Traveller","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_ST_ad.jpg","author_guid":"H4RK4QWUGLIDPNAWXJ5JPE4YSQ","score":0.77905264350297,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-afeb4d19-72c3-3dff-b6b1-69b7597cd92f_a-c1b93974-9b89-3100-b87e-11e05c5fcffa","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-afeb4d19-72c3-3dff-b6b1-69b7597cd92f_a-c1b93974-9b89-3100-b87e-11e05c5fcffa","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Bloomberg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/good-news-401-k-tax-090116382.html","img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/c3dcb3f60d1d05fbb7d4ec86ced7dce2","title":"There\u2019s Some Good News About 401(k)s in the Tax Bill","summary":"Hardship withdrawal and loan repayment rules are tweaked","published_at":1509745034,"content_id":"c1b93974-9b89-3100-b87e-11e05c5fcffa","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/good-news-401-k-tax-090116382.html","content_published_at":1509699676,"content_relative_time":86,"vibe_name":"[legacy] NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1509793803,"comment_relative_time":60,"bot":false},{"text":"Are there any ordinary Republicans out there who really think that their legislators are putting together a tax bill that will help US and not just the corporations that pay lobbyists and legislators to make sure they get what they want?

Imagine a tax code that gives you breaks for NOT having children. You get 1500 a kid right ?  Why not make it the other way around : if you dont have kids because you are not earning enough , we give u a tax credit and it goes into a 401k type account . Remember fiscal conservatives that we are talking about personal earnings . The money was earned by the taxpayer . We are just rewriting the tax code to incentivize personal and fiscal responsibility. People who choose to not have kids , seeing they are poor , would now get a break on their taxes so they could save , pay student loans , subsist Without GR or other services from the government. Just one example of my way to make improvements and mitigate the widening gap between haves and have nots  . Rememeber this is earned tax revenue NOT welfare . Im suggesting we streamline ways to get people out of poverty by themselves or thier own revenue .

This team is dialed in on defense and holding off opponents eager for offensive rebounds = #1 defense. Another  factor is  this year the second team better than any Coach Stevens has had.  Semi Ojeleye was still playing deep into the 4th quarter seems his defense is winning him a regular

They are young and talented, and sharp-shooting guard Bradley Beal believes they are ready to take the step up to the top of their conference. \"For us, we have all of our pieces. We got our core back together. We've got playoff experience. There's really no excuse for us not to take that next step,\" Beal told ESPN. \"We control our own destiny at this point.\" \"I feel like we're the best team [in the Eastern Conference],\" Beal added.","published_at":1509744858,"content_id":"a589f88d-cdc8-3393-8dbb-e669f384c4a8","content_url":"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/article\/2017\/11\/03\/lebron-james-silences-confident-wizards-milestone-filled-performance\/?rss=true","content_published_at":1509783853,"content_relative_time":63,"vibe_name":"[legacy] NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":63,"bot":true}]);
