In fact, back when the NBA was establishing itself as basketballs version of the WWE (WWF at that time), players routinely appeared in TV shows, movies, commercials, and even made rap albums.  Shaq, Allen Iverson, Chris Webber, Tony Parker, Kobe Bryant, Steve Francis, Kevin Durant, Lou Williams, Lance Stephenson, Joe Smith, Metta World Peace, and Iman Shumpert have all been known to dabble in music, if not release full blown CDs.  Stars like Kobe, Ewing, and Barkley were on a number of TV shows, ranging from Martin to Moesha, and several stars have been in movies, including Shaq (Blue Chips, Steel, Kazaam), Barkley (Space Jam), Ewing (Space jam, Senseless), Mark Jackson (Eddie), Dennis Rodman (Double Team, Simon Sez), John Salley (Bad Boys I & II, Eddie), LeBron (Trainwreck) and even Michael Jordan (Space Jam).  I honestly hope that more players get into the arts and do more things that expose them to other cultures; it helps to build their brand and make them memorable.  I think it helps them to realize their star power as well and maybe they will be apt to taking on the responsibility of being \"the guy\" when it comes to leading their teams; seems to have worked for guys prior to them.  We won't ever forget those players during the golden age, but most people can't remember who was drafted in the top 10 six years ago because half of those guys aren't even in the league anymore.","message_id":"c9780f9b-2686-4aca-9012-fd04344a37d0","context_id":"0780f9e8-8e5d-319c-967e-a6017bffe7c6","upvotes":5,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Brandon","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_jl_2.jpg","author_guid":"AKZIJ4EXYDBITXGP5FH4LJ3XZM","score":0.68779555511953,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-e27555d0-c6e2-3f5f-b568-18bca2b5cea2_a-0780f9e8-8e5d-319c-967e-a6017bffe7c6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/damian-lillard-debuts-billboards-emerging-artists-chart-new-album-343riq5","author":"nanook","provider":"Ball Don't Lie","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/damian-lillard-debuts-billboards-emerging-artists-chart-new-album-015553167.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/04a6fff6c00f82b76dda01d9c30c1877","title":"Damian Lillard debuts on Billboard's Emerging Artists chart with new album","summary":"Dame D.O.L.L.A, aka Blazers' Damian Lillard, finds success with his sophomore album.","published_at":1508378153,"content_id":"0780f9e8-8e5d-319c-967e-a6017bffe7c6","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/damian-lillard-debuts-billboards-emerging-artists-chart-new-album-015553167.html","content_published_at":1508378153,"content_relative_time":21,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508423477,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":false},{"text":"c'mon, we are setting up the season for another Golden State Warriors Championship.
