For all you protestors who have never served their country, take a stroll through Arlington Cemetery and teach your children some history below while you spend all the big money you  are making.  There are allot of families whose sons and daughters never see either parents alive again because they died protecting your #$%$! Your history below, cry me a river!  Woe is me!Think back when the slaves were brought to this country (put on the ships for slave trading by their own people). Only the heathiest and the biggest were put on the ships because they were the most prized. As those slaves propagated in this country and subsequently won their freedom they developed into larger, quicker, & stronger race from their selective ancestors that still exist in Africa. Now that they make millions in sports, and although their ancestors went through allot, it was better that the alternative that would have faced in Africa if they never came here. So now that those millionaires (sports, music, actors, etc.) want to protest how badly this country is for them, when the majority of them never served this country in any capacity. Their alternative could be, they could be standing on a river bank in Africa with a spear waiting for a fish to swim by. Be a little more humble like the other immigrants who came in the past, and also went through hard times, and are proud to be US citizens!  Blacks weren?t the only slaves! Four months before the 1st shipment of Black Slaves into America colonies, 100 white children were sent to American colonies in 1619. King James II, followed by Charles I, and Oliver Cromwell, sold over 500,000 Irish Catholics into slavery.","message_id":"6e98dc39-97f5-4e19-9471-a6629aed960e","context_id":"d3e08896-15e0-3e5e-a2e8-3038c8b9cc5b","upvotes":2,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Edward","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_E_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"4QYJZCSTCYZXGTIPUD4KWCYH4U","score":0.47629367141096,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-586f091e-6453-3840-9edc-6c97e556c314_a-d3e08896-15e0-3e5e-a2e8-3038c8b9cc5b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/nba-three-things-know-nets-21v9471","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nba-three-things-know-nets-115108729.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/nbcsports.com\/1341e0fd453c1a9a59703a7320b21bb4","title":"NBA Three Things to Know: Nets beat Cavaliers, messing up that first-round pick","summary":"Also, Wizards do not respect young Lakers and pay the price with a loss.","published_at":1509018855,"content_id":"d3e08896-15e0-3e5e-a2e8-3038c8b9cc5b","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nba-three-things-know-nets-115108729.html","content_published_at":1509018668,"content_relative_time":4,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1509028128,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"Lebron was Brilliant?

James' triple-double not enough as Cavs fall to Nets","summary":"But even a triple-double from LeBron James wasn't enough to outlast the plucky Nets on Wednesday night. James started at the point for the Cavaliers for the second straight game -- and led them back from a 14-point hole to take a fourth-quarter lead -- before missing two key free throws with a chance to tie in the closing seconds of a 112-107 loss at Barclays Center. LeBron finished with 29 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for the Cavs (3-2), while Spencer Dinwiddie paced the Nets (also 3-2) with 22 points, including a go-ahead three with 45 seconds remaining. With imported All-Star Isaiah Thomas sidelined long-term and veterans Dwyane Wade and ex-Knick Derrick Rose nursing minor injuries, James also had netted 34 points and dished out 13 assists in 37 minutes the previous night in a 119-112 home win over Chicago.","published_at":1508974337,"content_id":"941801b9-656f-35e0-bfc1-656d7dab6c64","content_url":"http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/sports\/basketball\/nets\/lebron-james-triple-double-not-cavs-fall-nets-article-1.3589158?utm_content=buffer93843&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=NYDNSports+Twitter","content_published_at":1508984174,"content_relative_time":14,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":14,"bot":true},{"text":"Mental illness does Not discriminate...rich, poor, black, white, man, woman, young, or old....It has no bounds.","message_id":"dd9d7454-493b-486d-8eda-a33ec0fc56a9","context_id":"c3259d85-e0df-377d-b7e8-81f7ff1b6380","upvotes":143,"downvotes":11,"reports":0,"replies":8,"author_name":"birddirt","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_ald.jpg","author_guid":"HRMSOXJV2CGKTLN2YEDZ5ZPRWE","score":0.92597923465745,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-c65e21cb-7178-3a14-8041-3d243eef65c2_a-c3259d85-e0df-377d-b7e8-81f7ff1b6380","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/report-ben-gordon-hospitalized-psychiatric-evaluation-disturbing-incident-2hh0isg","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Ball Don't Lie","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/report-ben-gordon-hospitalized-psychiatric-evaluation-disturbing-incident-170250645.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/9c773ad38acf6ccfe28afce406b5d2c8","title":"Report: Ben Gordon hospitalized for psychiatric evaluation after disturbing incident","summary":"Former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Ben Gordon was reportedly transported by police to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation following a disturbing incident in his hometown.","published_at":1508949670,"content_id":"c3259d85-e0df-377d-b7e8-81f7ff1b6380","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/report-ben-gordon-hospitalized-psychiatric-evaluation-disturbing-incident-170250645.html","content_published_at":1508950970,"content_relative_time":23,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508955443,"comment_relative_time":22,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"Add president Lol","message_id":"dd9d7454-493b-486d-8eda-a33ec0fc56a9","context_id":"c3259d85-e0df-377d-b7e8-81f7ff1b6380","upvotes":22,"downvotes":5,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"NativeAK","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_N_ald.jpg","score":0.78116753018068,"created_at":1508955825,"comment_relative_time":22,"bot":false}},{"text":"Prayers to him indeed.

Life changed and the work hard, play hard finally caught up to me. I have been on hydro's 7.5 for about 9 years. I adhere to what the  script  says. Now I get treated as a addict. MJ does more for me than pain killers. My body is addicted to pain killers, but mentally I am not. I would rather use something that has been around thousands of years as a remedy, than some one who cooked up chemicals that do work but are highly addictive and now the Gov if they had their way would like to make both harder to attain. If you are in pain 24hrs a day for so many years, you really  get to a point where you don't care. There have been times in my life where I had a episode that the pain was so bad that offered I would have shot heroin or morphine I didn't care, and I made a promise to myself I would never use a needle on myself. I have kept that promise for over 50 yrs, but like I said there has been times, pain can really screw with your mind. I would have a natural drug that won't kill you, and doesn't have bad side affects. And people I have quit things in my life, and MJ was the no big deal, compared to cigs which I have tried a number of times is hell. Quitting a anti depressants is no joy ride. MJ is only addictive if you think it is, but there is no huge side affects. I have been given drugs that said a side affect were what I was taking to get rid of. And my problem is I have a high tolerance. I have seen people take the lowest of hydros and they act drunk. All hyro's do for me is make my pain tolerable which is ok. To be pain free, means a much stronger drug, and the stronger you take, the harder to get off.

Just an hour later, Suns head coach Earl Watson was fired.According to ABC15 Sports, Bledsoe told Suns GM Ryan McDonough the tweet was in reference to him being at a hair salon, rather than in reference to playing for the Suns. McDonough said he \"didn't believe that to be true\" and that \"he won't be with us going forward.\" ESPN's Chris Haynes added more fuel to the fire, reporting Bledsoe met with the team before shootaround Monday morning, was sent home and will not play in Monday night's game against the Sacramento Kings.Wojnarowski reports interest in Bledsoe around the NBA increased once his desire to leave became clear. Bledsoe, 27, was the No. 18 pick in the 2010 NBA draft and has played for the Suns since 2013. Last season, the former Kentucky guard averaged a career-best 21.1 points and 6.3 assists per game. In three games this season, Bledsoe is averaging 15.7 points and three assists per game.Phoenix has lost its first three games of the season by an average margin of 30.67 points, including a 124-76 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on opening-night, the biggest loss in franchise history.","published_at":1508820750,"content_id":"2acdd0b0-e245-3009-a2f4-fb8f2c120504","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/report-suns-discussing-eric-bledsoe-174137492.html","content_published_at":1508780497,"content_relative_time":70,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508951857,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":false},{"text":"Ive always been a supporter of Reinsdorf however its time to cut ties with this combative, confrontational  and aggressive management.

Just an hour later, Suns head coach Earl Watson was fired.According to ABC15 Sports, Bledsoe told Suns GM Ryan McDonough the tweet was in reference to him being at a hair salon, rather than in reference to playing for the Suns. McDonough said he \"didn't believe that to be true\" and that \"he won't be with us going forward.\" ESPN's Chris Haynes added more fuel to the fire, reporting Bledsoe met with the team before shootaround Monday morning, was sent home and will not play in Monday night's game against the Sacramento Kings.Wojnarowski reports interest in Bledsoe around the NBA increased once his desire to leave became clear. Bledsoe, 27, was the No. 18 pick in the 2010 NBA draft and has played for the Suns since 2013. Last season, the former Kentucky guard averaged a career-best 21.1 points and 6.3 assists per game. In three games this season, Bledsoe is averaging 15.7 points and three assists per game.Phoenix has lost its first three games of the season by an average margin of 30.67 points, including a 124-76 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on opening-night, the biggest loss in franchise history.","published_at":1508820750,"content_id":"2acdd0b0-e245-3009-a2f4-fb8f2c120504","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/report-suns-discussing-eric-bledsoe-174137492.html","content_published_at":1508780497,"content_relative_time":70,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},"created_at":1508866968,"comment_relative_time":46,"bot":false},{"text":"The gun thing is stupid and he should be punished for it, but you silly people need to get off of your moral high horses.

It was the first start at point guard for James since 2005, and his passing ability led to the Cavs' recovery from a poor first half. James connected well with the Cavs' outside scoring options, with\u00a0Kyle Korver adding 11 points and registering a\u00a0plus\/minus of +10 in 23 minutes on the floor.

Just an hour later, Suns head coach Earl Watson was fired.According to ABC15 Sports, Bledsoe told Suns GM Ryan McDonough the tweet was in reference to him being at a hair salon, rather than in reference to playing for the Suns.
