The storm has already left at least 10 dead and is wreaking havoc in the Caribbean as it heads towards Cuba and America. The President\u2019s Caribbean mansion, Le Chateau des Palmiers,\u00a0is based on the Island of St Martin, which has already suffered significant damage. Officials on the small island said 95 per cent of it had been flattened as Irma hit this morning,\u00a0including its airport. However the status of Mr Trump\u2019s 11-bedroom property is currently unknown. Aerial photograph of the aftermath of Irma on the Dutch half of St Martin, Sint Maarten\u00a0 Credit: AFP Mr Trump purchased the beach-sided Le Chateau des Palmiers in 2013 and it is currently held by a trust to avoid\u00a0conflict of interest while he is in office. While it was initially a popular destination for the Trump family, in more recent years the billionaire has rented it out. The property is currently up for sale and the\u00a0asking price was dropped\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0from $28m (\u00a321.4m) to $17m (\u00a313m).\u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile Irma\u00a0is currently barreling towards Florida, where Mr Trump has other significant property holdings, principally his $200m (\u00a3153m) opulent private resort, Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump's Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago Credit: Reuters The sprawling Palm Beach residence is one of the jewels in Trump property empire and he has visited it frequently since taking office. It was originally built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather, who bequeathed it to the US Government as a 'winter Whitehouse' after her death in 1973. Mr Trump purchased the estate from the Reagan administration in 1985 for $10m. Since then the 17-acre country club has been\u00a0renovated\u00a0into an extravagant baroque private members club and spa. Financial returns show Mr Trump made over $15m (\u00a311.4m) in 2015 from Mar-a-Lago and that number will have likely increased since his election, due to the pulling-power of proximity to the President. The palatial interior of Mar-a-Lag Credit: Splash News Other lavish Trump properties at risk from Irma include Trump Towers, three 45-storey condo towers on Sunny Isles Beach. Some of the high-end flats in the development have\u00a0gone for as much as $3m (\u00a32.2m). Mr Trump also owns three luxury golf courses in Florida: Trump National Golf Club, in Jupiter, Trump International Golf Course, in West Palm Beach, and Trump National Doral Miami. Map: Trump resorts in Hurricane Irma's path President Trump\u00a0is not the only wealthy\u00a0individual with substantial\u00a0property at risk in the storm. Richard Branson rode out the hurricane on his private Necker Island resort. The British billionaire hunkered down in is wine cellar as Irma passed. His son Sam confirmed that no one on the island was hurt but many buildings were damaged.

The storm has already left at least 10 dead and is wreaking havoc in the Caribbean as it heads towards Cuba and America. The President\u2019s Caribbean mansion, Le Chateau des Palmiers,\u00a0is based on the Island of St Martin, which has already suffered significant damage. Officials on the small island said 95 per cent of it had been flattened as Irma hit this morning,\u00a0including its airport. However the status of Mr Trump\u2019s 11-bedroom property is currently unknown. Aerial photograph of the aftermath of Irma on the Dutch half of St Martin, Sint Maarten\u00a0 Credit: AFP Mr Trump purchased the beach-sided Le Chateau des Palmiers in 2013 and it is currently held by a trust to avoid\u00a0conflict of interest while he is in office. While it was initially a popular destination for the Trump family, in more recent years the billionaire has rented it out. The property is currently up for sale and the\u00a0asking price was dropped\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0from $28m (\u00a321.4m) to $17m (\u00a313m).\u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile Irma\u00a0is currently barreling towards Florida, where Mr Trump has other significant property holdings, principally his $200m (\u00a3153m) opulent private resort, Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump's Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago Credit: Reuters The sprawling Palm Beach residence is one of the jewels in Trump property empire and he has visited it frequently since taking office. It was originally built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather, who bequeathed it to the US Government as a 'winter Whitehouse' after her death in 1973. Mr Trump purchased the estate from the Reagan administration in 1985 for $10m. Since then the 17-acre country club has been\u00a0renovated\u00a0into an extravagant baroque private members club and spa. Financial returns show Mr Trump made over $15m (\u00a311.4m) in 2015 from Mar-a-Lago and that number will have likely increased since his election, due to the pulling-power of proximity to the President. The palatial interior of Mar-a-Lag Credit: Splash News Other lavish Trump properties at risk from Irma include Trump Towers, three 45-storey condo towers on Sunny Isles Beach. Some of the high-end flats in the development have\u00a0gone for as much as $3m (\u00a32.2m). Mr Trump also owns three luxury golf courses in Florida: Trump National Golf Club, in Jupiter, Trump International Golf Course, in West Palm Beach, and Trump National Doral Miami. Map: Trump resorts in Hurricane Irma's path President Trump\u00a0is not the only wealthy\u00a0individual with substantial\u00a0property at risk in the storm. Richard Branson rode out the hurricane on his private Necker Island resort. The British billionaire hunkered down in is wine cellar as Irma passed. His son Sam confirmed that no one on the island was hurt but many buildings were damaged. Other celebrities potentially affected include Oprah Winfrey, who has a mansion on Antigua, Bruce Willis, who has a home on Turks and Caicos as well as Eddie Murphy, Johnny Depp and illusionist David Copperfield, who all own private islands in the Bahamas.\u00a0 Hurricane Irma batters the Caribbean, in pictures \u00a0","published_at":1504781615,"content_id":"ce746404-f09a-3214-9800-39154cd84a5e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/hurricane-irma-barreling-towards-donald-134704986.html","content_published_at":1504792024,"content_relative_time":1017,"vibe_name":"Mar-a-Lago","vibe_id":"93c20339-94e8-3bc1-92a6-69efcfe7df32"},"created_at":1504809413,"comment_relative_time":1012,"bot":false},{"text":"Only a liberal is stupid enough to still be in southern Florida.

The storm has already left at least 10 dead and is wreaking havoc in the Caribbean as it heads towards Cuba and America. The President\u2019s Caribbean mansion, Le Chateau des Palmiers,\u00a0is based on the Island of St Martin, which has already suffered significant damage. Officials on the small island said 95 per cent of it had been flattened as Irma hit this morning,\u00a0including its airport. However the status of Mr Trump\u2019s 11-bedroom property is currently unknown. Aerial photograph of the aftermath of Irma on the Dutch half of St Martin, Sint Maarten\u00a0 Credit: AFP Mr Trump purchased the beach-sided Le Chateau des Palmiers in 2013 and it is currently held by a trust to avoid\u00a0conflict of interest while he is in office. While it was initially a popular destination for the Trump family, in more recent years the billionaire has rented it out. The property is currently up for sale and the\u00a0asking price was dropped\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0from $28m (\u00a321.4m) to $17m (\u00a313m).\u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile Irma\u00a0is currently barreling towards Florida, where Mr Trump has other significant property holdings, principally his $200m (\u00a3153m) opulent private resort, Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump's Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago Credit: Reuters The sprawling Palm Beach residence is one of the jewels in Trump property empire and he has visited it frequently since taking office. It was originally built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather, who bequeathed it to the US Government as a 'winter Whitehouse' after her death in 1973. Mr Trump purchased the estate from the Reagan administration in 1985 for $10m. Since then the 17-acre country club has been\u00a0renovated\u00a0into an extravagant baroque private members club and spa. Financial returns show Mr Trump made over $15m (\u00a311.4m) in 2015 from Mar-a-Lago and that number will have likely increased since his election, due to the pulling-power of proximity to the President. The palatial interior of Mar-a-Lag Credit: Splash News Other lavish Trump properties at risk from Irma include Trump Towers, three 45-storey condo towers on Sunny Isles Beach. Some of the high-end flats in the development have\u00a0gone for as much as $3m (\u00a32.2m). Mr Trump also owns three luxury golf courses in Florida: Trump National Golf Club, in Jupiter, Trump International Golf Course, in West Palm Beach, and Trump National Doral Miami. Map: Trump resorts in Hurricane Irma's path President Trump\u00a0is not the only wealthy\u00a0individual with substantial\u00a0property at risk in the storm. Richard Branson rode out the hurricane on his private Necker Island resort. The British billionaire hunkered down in is wine cellar as Irma passed. His son Sam confirmed that no one on the island was hurt but many buildings were damaged. Other celebrities potentially affected include Oprah Winfrey, who has a mansion on Antigua, Bruce Willis, who has a home on Turks and Caicos as well as Eddie Murphy, Johnny Depp and illusionist David Copperfield, who all own private islands in the Bahamas.\u00a0 Hurricane Irma batters the Caribbean, in pictures \u00a0","published_at":1504781615,"content_id":"ce746404-f09a-3214-9800-39154cd84a5e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/hurricane-irma-barreling-towards-donald-134704986.html","content_published_at":1504792024,"content_relative_time":1017,"vibe_name":"Mar-a-Lago","vibe_id":"93c20339-94e8-3bc1-92a6-69efcfe7df32"},"created_at":1504792665,"comment_relative_time":1017,"bot":false},{"text":"\"It's the safest place in the world for a hurricane,\" said Anthony Senecal----- Perhaps it should  be opened as a safe place for the normal folks !","message_id":"0fb4d383-3aca-4ce7-9003-7743b1019f6a","context_id":"8de7299a-17aa-3e64-8d2a-f50d7cf81426","upvotes":145,"downvotes":36,"reports":0,"replies":10,"author_name":"Alicia","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_A_ad.jpg","author_guid":"44OZHDGKN77QGTSX7LM3WPCKHI","score":0.81598233013417,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-93c20339-94e8-3bc1-92a6-69efcfe7df32_c-1ae3ee84-02e0-3fb9-8fd9-fa488e3c12d4_a-8de7299a-17aa-3e64-8d2a-f50d7cf81426","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mar-a-lago\/irma-vs-mar-lago-smart-trumps-house-cyjvkqj","author":"third_watch","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/irma-vs-mar-lago-smart-trumps-house-083700526.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/ap_webfeeds\/ea50dd92308e4e7abacfc66144e25c66.jpg","title":"For Irma vs. Mar-a-Lago, the smart $$ is on Trump's house","summary":"PALM BEACH, Fla.

Donald Trump's Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago Credit: Reuters The sprawling Palm Beach residence is one of the jewels in Trump property empire and he has visited it frequently since taking office. It was originally built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather, who bequeathed it to the US Government as a 'winter Whitehouse' after her death in 1973. Mr Trump purchased the estate from the Reagan administration in 1985 for $10m. Since then the 17-acre country club has been\u00a0renovated\u00a0into an extravagant baroque private members club and spa. Financial returns show Mr Trump made over $15m (\u00a311.4m) in 2015 from Mar-a-Lago and that number will have likely increased since his election, due to the pulling-power of proximity to the President.

Some of the high-end flats in the development have\u00a0gone for as much as $3m (\u00a32.2m). Mr Trump also owns three luxury golf courses in Florida: Trump National Golf Club, in Jupiter, Trump International Golf Course, in West Palm Beach, and Trump National Doral Miami.

Aerial photograph of the aftermath of Irma on the Dutch half of St Martin, Sint Maarten\u00a0 Credit: AFP Mr Trump purchased the beach-sided Le Chateau des Palmiers in 2013 and it is currently held by a trust to avoid\u00a0conflict of interest while he is in office. While it was initially a popular destination for the Trump family, in more recent years the billionaire has rented it out. The property is currently up for sale and the\u00a0asking price was dropped\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0from $28m (\u00a321.4m) to $17m (\u00a313m).\u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile Irma\u00a0is currently barreling towards Florida, where Mr Trump has other significant property holdings, principally his $200m (\u00a3153m) opulent private resort, Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump's Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago Credit: Reuters The sprawling Palm Beach residence is one of the jewels in Trump property empire and he has visited it frequently since taking office. It was originally built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather, who bequeathed it to the US Government as a 'winter Whitehouse' after her death in 1973. Mr Trump purchased the estate from the Reagan administration in 1985 for $10m. Since then the 17-acre country club has been\u00a0renovated\u00a0into an extravagant baroque private members club and spa. Financial returns show Mr Trump made over $15m (\u00a311.4m) in 2015 from Mar-a-Lago and that number will have likely increased since his election, due to the pulling-power of proximity to the President. The palatial interior of Mar-a-Lag Credit: Splash News Other lavish Trump properties at risk from Irma include Trump Towers, three 45-storey condo towers on Sunny Isles Beach. Some of the high-end flats in the development have\u00a0gone for as much as $3m (\u00a32.2m). Mr Trump also owns three luxury golf courses in Florida: Trump National Golf Club, in Jupiter, Trump International Golf Course, in West Palm Beach, and Trump National Doral Miami. Map: Trump resorts in Hurricane Irma's path President Trump\u00a0is not the only wealthy\u00a0individual with substantial\u00a0property at risk in the storm. Richard Branson rode out the hurricane on his private Necker Island resort. The British billionaire hunkered down in is wine cellar as Irma passed. His son Sam confirmed that no one on the island was hurt but many buildings were damaged. Other celebrities potentially affected include Oprah Winfrey, who has a mansion on Antigua, Bruce Willis, who has a home on Turks and Caicos as well as Eddie Murphy, Johnny Depp and illusionist David Copperfield, who all own private islands in the Bahamas.\u00a0 Hurricane Irma batters the Caribbean, in pictures \u00a0","published_at":1504781615,"content_id":"ce746404-f09a-3214-9800-39154cd84a5e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/hurricane-irma-barreling-towards-donald-134704986.html","content_published_at":1504792024,"content_relative_time":1017,"vibe_name":"Mar-a-Lago","vibe_id":"93c20339-94e8-3bc1-92a6-69efcfe7df32"},"created_at":1504811367,"comment_relative_time":1011,"bot":false},{"text":"\"The Trump family business doubled the initiation fee to $200,000 once it became clear that Mar-a-Lago would become the unofficial Winter White House,\"  ..............The first family of crooks, liars and traitors hard at work getting richer off the presidency.","message_id":"a109b8da-7eb8-4855-b390-11f9fe7232f5","context_id":"8de7299a-17aa-3e64-8d2a-f50d7cf81426","upvotes":146,"downvotes":51,"reports":0,"replies":11,"author_name":"Chris P.

The storm has already left at least 10 dead and is wreaking havoc in the Caribbean as it heads towards Cuba and America. The President\u2019s Caribbean mansion, Le Chateau des Palmiers,\u00a0is based on the Island of St Martin, which has already suffered significant damage. Officials on the small island said 95 per cent of it had been flattened as Irma hit this morning,\u00a0including its airport. However the status of Mr Trump\u2019s 11-bedroom property is currently unknown. Aerial photograph of the aftermath of Irma on the Dutch half of St Martin, Sint Maarten\u00a0 Credit: AFP Mr Trump purchased the beach-sided Le Chateau des Palmiers in 2013 and it is currently held by a trust to avoid\u00a0conflict of interest while he is in office. While it was initially a popular destination for the Trump family, in more recent years the billionaire has rented it out. The property is currently up for sale and the\u00a0asking price was dropped\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0from $28m (\u00a321.4m) to $17m (\u00a313m).\u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile Irma\u00a0is currently barreling towards Florida, where Mr Trump has other significant property holdings, principally his $200m (\u00a3153m) opulent private resort, Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump's Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago Credit: Reuters The sprawling Palm Beach residence is one of the jewels in Trump property empire and he has visited it frequently since taking office. It was originally built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather, who bequeathed it to the US Government as a 'winter Whitehouse' after her death in 1973. Mr Trump purchased the estate from the Reagan administration in 1985 for $10m. Since then the 17-acre country club has been\u00a0renovated\u00a0into an extravagant baroque private members club and spa. Financial returns show Mr Trump made over $15m (\u00a311.4m) in 2015 from Mar-a-Lago and that number will have likely increased since his election, due to the pulling-power of proximity to the President. The palatial interior of Mar-a-Lag Credit: Splash News Other lavish Trump properties at risk from Irma include Trump Towers, three 45-storey condo towers on Sunny Isles Beach. Some of the high-end flats in the development have\u00a0gone for as much as $3m (\u00a32.2m). Mr Trump also owns three luxury golf courses in Florida: Trump National Golf Club, in Jupiter, Trump International Golf Course, in West Palm Beach, and Trump National Doral Miami. Map: Trump resorts in Hurricane Irma's path President Trump\u00a0is not the only wealthy\u00a0individual with substantial\u00a0property at risk in the storm. Richard Branson rode out the hurricane on his private Necker Island resort. The British billionaire hunkered down in is wine cellar as Irma passed. His son Sam confirmed that no one on the island was hurt but many buildings were damaged. Other celebrities potentially affected include Oprah Winfrey, who has a mansion on Antigua, Bruce Willis, who has a home on Turks and Caicos as well as Eddie Murphy, Johnny Depp and illusionist David Copperfield, who all own private islands in the Bahamas.\u00a0 Hurricane Irma batters the Caribbean, in pictures \u00a0","published_at":1504781615,"content_id":"ce746404-f09a-3214-9800-39154cd84a5e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/hurricane-irma-barreling-towards-donald-134704986.html","content_published_at":1504792024,"content_relative_time":1017,"vibe_name":"Mar-a-Lago","vibe_id":"93c20339-94e8-3bc1-92a6-69efcfe7df32"},"created_at":1504814098,"comment_relative_time":1011,"bot":false},{"text":"Have tax payers been on the hook to preserve MAR-A-LAGO?","message_id":"f8f2bbf8-2ec3-4d3d-afaf-28b1293bc4e8","context_id":"8de7299a-17aa-3e64-8d2a-f50d7cf81426","upvotes":292,"downvotes":137,"reports":0,"replies":32,"author_name":"luckysteg","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_L_jd_1_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"XPW7C5MND7B3MTFVESOEYCE55I","score":0.70097517826199,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-93c20339-94e8-3bc1-92a6-69efcfe7df32_c-1ae3ee84-02e0-3fb9-8fd9-fa488e3c12d4_a-8de7299a-17aa-3e64-8d2a-f50d7cf81426","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mar-a-lago\/irma-vs-mar-lago-smart-trumps-house-cyjvkqj","author":"third_watch","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/irma-vs-mar-lago-smart-trumps-house-083700526.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/ap_webfeeds\/ea50dd92308e4e7abacfc66144e25c66.jpg","title":"For Irma vs. Mar-a-Lago, the smart $$ is on Trump's house","summary":"PALM BEACH, Fla.

The storm has already left at least 10 dead and is wreaking havoc in the Caribbean as it heads towards Cuba and America. The President\u2019s Caribbean mansion, Le Chateau des Palmiers,\u00a0is based on the Island of St Martin, which has already suffered significant damage. Officials on the small island said 95 per cent of it had been flattened as Irma hit this morning,\u00a0including its airport. However the status of Mr Trump\u2019s 11-bedroom property is currently unknown. Aerial photograph of the aftermath of Irma on the Dutch half of St Martin, Sint Maarten\u00a0 Credit: AFP Mr Trump purchased the beach-sided Le Chateau des Palmiers in 2013 and it is currently held by a trust to avoid\u00a0conflict of interest while he is in office. While it was initially a popular destination for the Trump family, in more recent years the billionaire has rented it out. The property is currently up for sale and the\u00a0asking price was dropped\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0from $28m (\u00a321.4m) to $17m (\u00a313m).\u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile Irma\u00a0is currently barreling towards Florida, where Mr Trump has other significant property holdings, principally his $200m (\u00a3153m) opulent private resort, Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump's Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago Credit: Reuters The sprawling Palm Beach residence is one of the jewels in Trump property empire and he has visited it frequently since taking office. It was originally built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather, who bequeathed it to the US Government as a 'winter Whitehouse' after her death in 1973. Mr Trump purchased the estate from the Reagan administration in 1985 for $10m. Since then the 17-acre country club has been\u00a0renovated\u00a0into an extravagant baroque private members club and spa. Financial returns show Mr Trump made over $15m (\u00a311.4m) in 2015 from Mar-a-Lago and that number will have likely increased since his election, due to the pulling-power of proximity to the President. The palatial interior of Mar-a-Lag Credit: Splash News Other lavish Trump properties at risk from Irma include Trump Towers, three 45-storey condo towers on Sunny Isles Beach. Some of the high-end flats in the development have\u00a0gone for as much as $3m (\u00a32.2m). Mr Trump also owns three luxury golf courses in Florida: Trump National Golf Club, in Jupiter, Trump International Golf Course, in West Palm Beach, and Trump National Doral Miami.
