Hurricane Irma, a Category 5 nightmare come alive, skirted north of Puerto Rico on Wednesday, battering but not decimating the U.S. territory, to the relief of its 3 million-plus residents. Irma slammed right into St. Maarten, where none other than President Trump owns an 11-bedroom compound called Le Chateau des Palmiers (\"Castle of Palms,\" but in French, so it's classy). Addressing the extent of St. Maarten's devastation, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomba told AFP: \u201cWe know that the four most solid buildings on the island have been destroyed, which means that more rustic structures have probably been completely or partially destroyed.\u201d It seems, in the least, the Trump Organization will have to spend a hefty sum on L\u00ea Chateau repairs.","published_at":1504884449,"content_id":"055d6974-8f2b-3bbc-a2b8-25ca4ba583a2","content_url":"https:\/\/www.gq.com\/story\/trump-mar-a-lago-hurricane-insurance","content_published_at":1504802771,"content_relative_time":967,"vibe_name":"Mar-a-Lago","vibe_id":"93c20339-94e8-3bc1-92a6-69efcfe7df32"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":967,"bot":true}]
