Does anyone really believe you can MASA by having our Chief Executive Office institutionalize stupidity, by their continual demonstration of governmental chaos & gross incompetence? \n\nThe systemic problem with the Trump Executive Office is not that the POTUS has the intelligence or personal impulse control of a 12 year old. The central problem with the Trump Administration is the POTUS has no real respect for the US Government institutions that it currently leads. President Trump continually demonstrates he has no respect for or even basic functional understanding of the other 2 branches of Government (Legislative & Judiciary). The erratic or false words & actions of the POTUS constantly undermines, demeans and insults the other Co-Equal Branches of the US Government with whom the Executive Office must share power & provide leadership for the USA in accordance with our Constitution. This reckless behavior and \"unhinged temperament\" is continually proven by Trumps' use of erratic & uncoordinated Tweets, endless False Statements or Lies, \"Alternate Facts\" (fake made-up facts), lack of human empathy and total inability to admit to being wrong about anything, therefore being unable to correct any of your mistakes. The gross incompetence demonstrated by the Trump Administration therefore demonstrate the President has no respect for the USA system of Government or the Constitution that it is based upon. Dear POTUS sorry to inform you your actions, words and lack of respect for the other institutions of US Government demonstrate you are unfit to hold the Office of President. \n\nThe unanswered question regarding the US Legislative Branch of Government, is why the majority of members of Congress have failed to demonstrate the principles or moral backbone to stand up and say to the POTUS, \"Enough Mr. Trump, Do You Have No Decency or Honor\" ? As far as the GOP is concerned with the notable exceptions of (John McCain, Jeff Flake & Bob Corker), they have clearly demonstrated that they have surrendered their \"Pledge of Duty to Country in favor of Loyalty to Party.\" It appears the GOP Legislators are willing to condone the Trump Administration dismantling of the US Government. These Executive Office misuses of power appear to be acceptable to the Legislative Branch as long as they think there is a chance of getting a Tax Cut to benefit their wealthy sponsors or donors. These Legislators feel confident they can simply come back after Trump is gone and then re-invoke the GOP's Moral Majority. Sorry, you have clearly demonstrated you have no moral authority and will soon thereafter, no longer represent the USA majority. \n\nMany in Congress are clearly willing to \"provide complicity and accommodation of the unacceptable\". The US Legislative Branch is demonstrating they are willing to sit silently and enable President Trump to attack, debase and dismantle the long standing institutions of our Government. This demolition of our Government institutions includes the general emasculation of our USA Federal Agencies\/Departments (Interior, EPA, Education, Energy, Justice Department, State Department). It shows a Legislative Leadership failure in speaking out against the Executive Office when clear attacks are made against our Constitutionally Guaranteed Freedoms (Freedom of Speech & the Press). It also condones rejection of accepted norms of human decency & respectful treatment of those who question or disagree with Executive Branch statements or actions. Our Constitutional Balance of Powers was not intended to be an abstract intellectual principal, it was intended to protect and preserve our treasured democracy. To the US Congress, the citizens you represent say please just do your jobs! If you fail to do your jobs, our Country will lose our moral authority and thereby respect in our Governments Institutional Authority.","message_id":"86349fe9-8b1f-43fa-bc3d-3c4e20c6db16","context_id":"575ce48c-9710-3cd3-a8a6-824836c04a19","upvotes":43,"downvotes":1,"reports":1,"replies":7,"author_name":"Robert","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_jd_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"BOBPOUNSFCAUQJZTXRFL54BO2M","score":0.79604136635912,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa_c-64b291af-98b5-36f3-a323-ab75f4c9f218_a-575ce48c-9710-3cd3-a8a6-824836c04a19","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/us-news\/sessions-gets-more-criticism-trump-russia-questions-622xpjl","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/sessions-gets-more-criticism-trump-russia-questions-063033913.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/ap_webfeeds\/1560c4d514ce4a56a3f1b4a6d423373a.jpg","title":"Sessions gets more criticism from Trump, Russia questions","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The nation's chief law enforcement officer is finding himself in a familiar spot: belittled by the president, pressured to investigate political opponents and sucked back into the center of the storm around the investigation into the Trump administration's campaign ties to Russia.","published_at":1509777082,"content_id":"575ce48c-9710-3cd3-a8a6-824836c04a19","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/sessions-gets-more-criticism-trump-russia-questions-063033913.html","content_published_at":1509777082,"content_relative_time":10,"vibe_name":"U.S. News","vibe_id":"ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa"},"created_at":1509786620,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":false},{"text":"Quick question: How many times does Sessions get to lie?","message_id":"3c9d020b-5db5-4ca8-bcfc-5c216c530875","context_id":"575ce48c-9710-3cd3-a8a6-824836c04a19","upvotes":49,"downvotes":4,"reports":1,"replies":3,"author_name":"Edward","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_E_ald.jpg","author_guid":"NB37E6B4WVOVZPPO3UQGCO4CJE","score":0.78448949473332,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa_c-64b291af-98b5-36f3-a323-ab75f4c9f218_a-575ce48c-9710-3cd3-a8a6-824836c04a19","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/us-news\/sessions-gets-more-criticism-trump-russia-questions-622xpjl","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/sessions-gets-more-criticism-trump-russia-questions-063033913.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/ap_webfeeds\/1560c4d514ce4a56a3f1b4a6d423373a.jpg","title":"Sessions gets more criticism from Trump, Russia questions","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The nation's chief law enforcement officer is finding himself in a familiar spot: belittled by the president, pressured to investigate political opponents and sucked back into the center of the storm around the investigation into the Trump administration's campaign ties to Russia.","published_at":1509777082,"content_id":"575ce48c-9710-3cd3-a8a6-824836c04a19","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/sessions-gets-more-criticism-trump-russia-questions-063033913.html","content_published_at":1509777082,"content_relative_time":10,"vibe_name":"U.S. News","vibe_id":"ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa"},"created_at":1509783519,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":false},{"text":"What type of morons would vote for someone like this idiot?
