Only Congress can spend money and they never signed off to Obama's reckless socialized medicine program. My hopes are that the whole thing is completely repealed, I never want government involved in my healthcare, that is private and my business, not theirs. And remember, once government gets a foothold, it never let's go, and it will only grow and grow and grow.","message_id":"850075a0-f754-4e90-a64d-e8b0b6bb5946","context_id":"6719d846-734d-310d-bf12-e7090ea96abf","upvotes":900,"downvotes":493,"reports":2,"replies":292,"author_name":"Mary","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/afa330e58eada28d55819eca341c7644_192.jpg","author_guid":"Y7DFTSRMUT3V4B5LXHCZKX6AAU","score":0.65091950335357,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa_c-b3ceac65-9c92-355c-b1e3-ab93f8bf3890_a-6719d846-734d-310d-bf12-e7090ea96abf","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/us-news\/judge-rejects-bid-18-u-states-revive-obamacare-203900092--sector-2alrif8","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/judge-rejects-bid-18-u-states-revive-obamacare-203900092--sector.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2017-10-25T230510Z_2_LYNXMPED9O1W7_RTROPTP_2_USA-HEALTHCARE-INSURERS.JPG","title":"Judge rejects bid by 18 states to revive Obamacare subsidies","summary":"By Dan Levine and Lawrence Hurley SAN FRANCISCO\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday refused to block President Donald Trump's decision to end subsidy payments to health insurers under Obamacare, handing Trump a victory against Democratic attorneys general who have regularly challenged the president's policies in court. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said the federal government did not have to make the payments\u00a0while litigation over the subsidies unfolds. Chhabria, appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, wrote that although the case appeared to be a close call, \"it appears initially that the Trump administration has the stronger legal argument.\" The Trump administration this month terminated the payments to the insurers, which help cover medical expenses for low-income Americans, as part of several moves to dismantle Obama's signature healthcare law formally known as the Affordable Care Act.","published_at":1508975124,"content_id":"6719d846-734d-310d-bf12-e7090ea96abf","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/judge-rejects-bid-18-u-states-revive-obamacare-203900092--sector.html","content_published_at":1508975124,"content_relative_time":16,"vibe_name":"U.S. News","vibe_id":"ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa"},"created_at":1508966037,"comment_relative_time":19,"bot":false}]);
