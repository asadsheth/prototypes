There needs to be a constitutional convention to impose a 28th amendment to get all private money out of politics. They are all to corrupt at the federal level to make such a thing happen. Republicans and Democrats alike. If we do not get this into the constitution I will guarantee you that it will get much worse than it is right now. Our politicians are actively writing laws that harm every citizen of the United States. They have rigged the system so you will always lose and be subservient to the banks and multi-national corporations. Please, please, please act locally before it is further beyond hope.","message_id":"dc03c93a-565a-4262-a078-df22a774e132","context_id":"42691a2f-3a13-34e6-93bf-73f3a4e0549a","upvotes":117,"downvotes":9,"reports":0,"replies":15,"author_name":"Craig","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_C_jl.jpg","author_guid":"4Q75MPQSGMY676UHWEOQWHWPHU","score":0.92298295768588,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-b8d0cc6a-4e88-38b7-8fd3-6d448513290a_a-42691a2f-3a13-34e6-93bf-73f3a4e0549a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/elizabeth-warren-reams-gop-apos-dj7dvey","author":"third_watch","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/elizabeth-warren-reams-gop-apos-113404776.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_huffington_post_584\/0db162ef99d58c1e30b3e70f1af86653","title":"Elizabeth Warren Reams GOP: 'The System Is Rigged' Against Americans","summary":"Sen.

Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue.

Anyway, the fact that government grows and grows and grows regardless of which party is in power tells you everything you need to know.","message_id":"78d97bf4-bcfd-458a-8542-109f76f9e87c","context_id":"a91a8129-862d-3f6b-96af-5eae03e08e53","upvotes":1,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"John","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"VRQZAXKCYNNBVDEFPWFPLPQIBY","score":0.3395700843609,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-24e9965c-8c02-3548-a528-81bd4ce833a6_a-a91a8129-862d-3f6b-96af-5eae03e08e53","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-24e9965c-8c02-3548-a528-81bd4ce833a6_a-a91a8129-862d-3f6b-96af-5eae03e08e53","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/fewer-third-americans-back-trump-tax-plan-reuters-192750092--business.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2017-10-24T192830Z_2_LYNXMPED9N1PU_RTROPTP_2_USA-TAX-TRUMP.JPG","title":"Fewer than a third of Americans back Trump tax plan: Reuters\/Ipsos poll","summary":"By Amanda Becker and Chris Kahn WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fewer than a third of Americans support Donald Trump's tax-cut plan, according to a Reuters\/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, as the U.S. president went to Capitol Hill looking for Republican backing for his proposal to slash tax rates for individuals and companies. Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue. Among Republicans surveyed, 63 percent said deficit reduction should take priority over tax cuts for corporations, while 75 percent said deficit reduction should take priority over tax cuts for the wealthy.","published_at":1508931685,"content_id":"a91a8129-862d-3f6b-96af-5eae03e08e53","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/fewer-third-americans-back-trump-tax-plan-reuters-192750092--business.html","content_published_at":1508873310,"content_relative_time":25,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508940886,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":false},{"text":"Sky's Falling.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508877744,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508934349,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":false},{"text":"My brother in law lived in China for five years.

That is to say, the PRC does indeed advocate \"state-atheism,\" but the reason authorities are increasingly cracking down on religious movements has much more to do with controlling subsets of the population who might be inspired or compelled to action (including, at least potentially, dissidence) by an ideology more than that of China's official \"communist\" principles (and of course that label is problematic given that many zones in China actually have less regulation and more private enterprise than most nominally capitalist countries). So when one considers the crackdown on Falun Gong (which continues to this day, but started almost 20 years ago directly because of a political protest by Falun Gong members), this renewed attempt to control religious practice in China is far, far more about retaining and enhancing political power for the PRC Communist Party and quashing any resistance than any atheist ideological platform.","message_id":"2c5a3c32-1798-453e-b3e2-7f8e381e5d4a","context_id":"2139c2bc-4a66-3a11-926b-55f1641e456c","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"United!!","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/17c01f21c8db4c5ba55987b1cb1904ac_192.jpg","author_guid":"MPBHQXJJNO5E5QRXML23W3VASA","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-5cf27f9e-774a-3b93-b7e1-e3b28c86466c_a-2139c2bc-4a66-3a11-926b-55f1641e456c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-5cf27f9e-774a-3b93-b7e1-e3b28c86466c_a-2139c2bc-4a66-3a11-926b-55f1641e456c","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/communist-china-president-xi-jinping-162254184.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/1b76943a83a959838c1044e0ea016b73","title":"Communist China President Xi Jinping Now Wants to Control Religion Too","summary":"Communist, atheist China wants to make the country\u2019s many religions, including Catholicism and Islam, more Chinese, President Xi Jinping declared during a marathon speech at his party\u2019s conference.

The strict following of Wahhabism version of Islam by the Saudi government has created lot of problems for the whole world.  Better late than never.  Turning towards moderate ideas of Islam will make many terrorist activities disappear which means peace and tranquility in the world, and also it will save lots of innocent lives.  This decision by the Saudi government needs to be applauded by all civilized nations.  The money spent on madrasses to train martyrs will be invested for the welfare of people.  This writer just wonders if other Muslim countries supporting jihadi ideology will take a cue from the Saudis and stop assisting fundamentalists and divert their financial resources towards meaningful channels.  I think it will be a good idea if the Saudi government publishes details of its new policy explaining modern Islam - for example, their policy towards stopping Jihadi ideology through mosques and madrasses, equal rights for all genders, freedom of speech and fundamental rights, equal rights for all people practicing different religions etc.","message_id":"b175fa47-ef5b-443a-b2b7-68302ab02054","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":141,"downvotes":13,"reports":0,"replies":26,"author_name":"Dharam","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ald.jpg","author_guid":"FKP6XRHAQXBOIXHF4FJMTMND6Y","score":0.91511831531243,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-2b74c091-5ff3-3279-af64-1c601caae774_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-2b74c091-5ff3-3279-af64-1c601caae774_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/d631b74dcaf6578e0ef456e029892e0e","title":"Saudi Arabia's crown prince promises to lead his country 'back to moderate Islam'","summary":"Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious young crown prince has said he will lead his country back to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d as he announced plans for a vast new \u00a3380 million economic development zone.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed bin Salman told investors gathered in Riyadh that his economic modernisation plans would go hand-in-hand with with political reforms to guide the conservative kingdom away from severe Wahhabi Islam.\u00a0 \"We are returning to what we were before - a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,\" the 32-year-old prince said. \"We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas. We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508877744,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508864110,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"Will never happen.

Kuwait isn't Saudi, but the two countries have enough in common that i can assess the plans that the prince is making.  I rate his chance of success as low.  He is squeezed by too many constraints.  He has to get major change before the oil revenue dries up (the world is already starting to turn its back on fossil fuels), which means he needs major change within 30 years or less.  The country has no significant natural resources other than oil, so its only hope will be the hard work and ingenuity of its people.  (Like Singapore, for example.)  But Saudis are not accustomed to hard work, and their education system does not turn out people who are creative and dynamic.  Also, the culture does not encourage innovation.  The religion encourages fatalism and passivity, not a \"can-do\" attitude.  Bringing massive and fundamental change to a culture and to its educational systems is certainly possible - but I don't think it is possible in a mere 30 years.  I think Saudi probably faces a very grim future.","message_id":"9f771861-0ed5-4c1c-b89b-172063ca3b20","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":26,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":4,"author_name":"Linda Sutherland","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_L_ad.jpg","author_guid":"XBBOAJV4H2TOADM3S36525BTUM","score":0.86428398463279,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-2b74c091-5ff3-3279-af64-1c601caae774_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-2b74c091-5ff3-3279-af64-1c601caae774_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/d631b74dcaf6578e0ef456e029892e0e","title":"Saudi Arabia's crown prince promises to lead his country 'back to moderate Islam'","summary":"Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious young crown prince has said he will lead his country back to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d as he announced plans for a vast new \u00a3380 million economic development zone.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed bin Salman told investors gathered in Riyadh that his economic modernisation plans would go hand-in-hand with with political reforms to guide the conservative kingdom away from severe Wahhabi Islam.\u00a0 \"We are returning to what we were before - a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,\" the 32-year-old prince said. \"We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas. We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508877744,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508875254,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"I was there in 1978 to 1980 and I agree with the above !!!","message_id":"9f771861-0ed5-4c1c-b89b-172063ca3b20","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":6,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"rob","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_jd.jpg","score":0.67348467128664,"created_at":1508884489,"comment_relative_time":21,"bot":false}},{"text":"Go Away Pervert.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed.

The interesting part will be how this can even go to arbitration since it takes both parties to agree to a contract and clearly millions of people did not agree to allow equifax to control their credit.","message_id":"23c88f08-962a-4112-bd77-8341b8f383c5","context_id":"a15630dd-8066-348b-a0f9-3bb92c2c3fd0","upvotes":42,"downvotes":1,"reports":1,"replies":1,"author_name":"picantels","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_P_jd_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"ZDGXDZZHNCKT3MZ3WD6E5OFMGM","score":0.79238998528939,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-e7e38cbe-2044-344b-9efe-7ec5d8d448ef_a-a15630dd-8066-348b-a0f9-3bb92c2c3fd0","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/congress-votes-disallow-consumers-suing-27myv0j","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"TechCrunch","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/congress-votes-disallow-consumers-suing-033159253.html","img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/slick-76021-1508947318707.jpg","title":"Congress votes to disallow consumers from suing Equifax and other companies with arbitration agreements","summary":"The Senate voted late Wednesday night to strike a federal rule that would have allowed consumers affected by the Equifax hack to sue the company.","published_at":1508900706,"content_id":"a15630dd-8066-348b-a0f9-3bb92c2c3fd0","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/congress-votes-disallow-consumers-suing-033159253.html","content_published_at":1508902319,"content_relative_time":17,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508903997,"comment_relative_time":16,"bot":false},{"text":"That can only happen if the Saudi Arabian rulers renounce the present fake religion, the radical Wahabi cult.","message_id":"cc46bf02-4e26-4b7a-b070-dc75ce65560c","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":12,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"AZ","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_A_mr.jpg","author_guid":"6RBKK627GHDI6JJVDS5FZJ4ENQ","score":0.78975312700842,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-2b74c091-5ff3-3279-af64-1c601caae774_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-2b74c091-5ff3-3279-af64-1c601caae774_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/d631b74dcaf6578e0ef456e029892e0e","title":"Saudi Arabia's crown prince promises to lead his country 'back to moderate Islam'","summary":"Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious young crown prince has said he will lead his country back to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d as he announced plans for a vast new \u00a3380 million economic development zone.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed bin Salman told investors gathered in Riyadh that his economic modernisation plans would go hand-in-hand with with political reforms to guide the conservative kingdom away from severe Wahhabi Islam.\u00a0 \"We are returning to what we were before - a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,\" the 32-year-old prince said. \"We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas. We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508877744,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508878081,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":false},{"text":"Odd that the Russian Troll bots haven't found this story yet.

Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508877744,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508875243,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":false},{"text":"Tax cuts for the 1% + deregulation =  large deficits + recession = Herbert Hoover, Ronald Reagan, George W.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508877744,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508898086,"comment_relative_time":18,"bot":false},{"text":"this kind of trickery is OK it will benefit the worker someday as social security is in trouble and only projected to pay 75% of originally expected distribution in the next 20 years, which I personally fall under that time frame being only 38, which is why I match my employer's 9% to make 18% between the both of us every week for 15 years, no 9ne cares about you like you do, especially not the government.","message_id":"0a3ae2cd-5309-4a3d-850c-0d1cf1bcfc88","context_id":"e4490dbe-8ac3-329a-8b4e-1571cb7d08c3","upvotes":7,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Gerald","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_G_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"EBO3C2ZQ4L7YUAIG7VGX4O3XCU","score":0.74465315323989,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-bab2e303-95a1-3c61-b8ce-5663ca9d83cb_a-e4490dbe-8ac3-329a-8b4e-1571cb7d08c3","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/employer-tricking-rescuing-retirement-w5qu28w","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Bloomberg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/employer-tricking-rescuing-retirement-080009543.html","img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/a22cbf38a67b12e021d83e4291ef895b","title":"Your Employer Is Tricking You Into Rescuing Your Retirement","summary":"Actually, it\u2019s more like a good deed, as more 401(k) plans make your inertia work for you instead of against you.","published_at":1508835920,"content_id":"e4490dbe-8ac3-329a-8b4e-1571cb7d08c3","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/employer-tricking-rescuing-retirement-080009543.html","content_published_at":1508832009,"content_relative_time":36,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508889267,"comment_relative_time":20,"bot":false},{"text":"The next big downturn will be revealing. \n\nNow that so much trading is robotic and so much of market volume is ETFs, we'll get to see what happens when everyone wants out of their ETFs at once.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508877744,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508864077,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":false},{"text":"Think about what Republicans are trying to sell to you.

Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508877744,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508888687,"comment_relative_time":20,"bot":false},{"text":"We no longer have a real democracy in this country.

Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue.

Given the current Administration and changing complexion of \"conservatism\", the possibility can be discounted.","message_id":"348e97d9-a2e0-4625-aab6-620376b22ae0","context_id":"d3aca797-6261-38c1-bff9-a590b5de0cbe","upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"santani","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_S_ald.jpg","author_guid":"RMC7U4PXUGUR3VLDB7ALISEOBY","score":0.59722425808824,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-d0646c50-06d9-3e20-9cde-5872990737ff_a-d3aca797-6261-38c1-bff9-a590b5de0cbe","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/einhorn-wonder-market-adopted-alternative-paradigm-4qcrtmc","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Yahoo Finance","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/einhorn-wonder-market-adopted-alternative-paradigm-163704878.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/b3471eb9ef2e0679f7c351f7750f0a06","title":"Einhorn: 'We wonder if the market has adopted an alternative paradigm'","summary":"'What if equity value has nothing to do with current or future profits...?'","published_at":1508857277,"content_id":"d3aca797-6261-38c1-bff9-a590b5de0cbe","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/einhorn-wonder-market-adopted-alternative-paradigm-163704878.html","content_published_at":1508863024,"content_relative_time":27,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508865572,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":false},{"text":"Since analysts tend to overestimate future earnings growth the most for \"glamour\" growth stocks, this list is very risky compared to one based on things like durable competitive advantages, long-term steady growth, long-term good return on equity, reasonable long term debt, and other signs of excellent management of the companies behind the stocks.\nI feel much safer that, instead of these stocks, I'll preserve capital and enjoy a good return on stocks like Abbott Labs, Southwest Airlines, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Welltower (HCN: a healthcare REIT with decades of steady growth), Emerson Electric (58 straight years of dividend growth), and even General Mills, whose GIS stock is down 13% this year after several straight years of double-digit growth.  GIS hasn't lowered its dividend (3.8% yield) in 118 years and has raised it the last 13 in a row.  When the market crashed by 45% between Sept. '08 and Mar. '09, GIS also crashed, by 33%, but in Dec. '09, just nine months later, GIS hit a new all-time high.  Even in recessions people keep buying Cheerios, Betty Crocker, Gold Metal Flour, Yoplait, Green Giant, etc.  THAT is a durable competitive advantage.\nLikewise, Abbott Labs is a leader in many things including hospital pumps, instant medical tests, and Similac baby formula - #1 even in China, and its dividend has increased for 43 straight years, right through the crashes of 1987, 2000-1, and 2008-9.\nCompared to the stocks I've mentioned, the list here is a mixture of pretenders and roll-the-dice glamour stocks.","message_id":"420fba36-097c-4a05-a900-71d997b63d3d","context_id":"f0fe0bd4-e84a-3374-8cf4-199995880408","upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"The_Mick","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/5af3c08880125cb4d4ab61b2f46407c7_192.jpeg","author_guid":"R6READ4TRHBCZ4BZ6AH2CRI3XM","score":0.59722425808824,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-b54e8640-5a46-3dab-a179-32dd9495aef0_a-f0fe0bd4-e84a-3374-8cf4-199995880408","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/goldman-sachs-only-50-stocks-2zfbkby","author":"nanook","provider":"Business Insider","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/goldman-sachs-only-50-stocks-132400816.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/businessinsider.com\/fa775494c2fe64772cec87cf00d8996d","title":"GOLDMAN SACHS: There are only 50 stocks in the world that are perfect for this environment","summary":"Reuters \/ John Gress","published_at":1508852546,"content_id":"f0fe0bd4-e84a-3374-8cf4-199995880408","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/goldman-sachs-only-50-stocks-132400816.html","content_published_at":1508902020,"content_relative_time":17,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508864953,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":false},{"text":"In other words the market is fixed.","message_id":"8bad6f4a-bae5-4a47-bf79-f5f3df96cf2b","context_id":"d3aca797-6261-38c1-bff9-a590b5de0cbe","upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"John","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"4YURW5UIPDDYJGEWMBZM5PLGHM","score":0.59722425808824,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-d0646c50-06d9-3e20-9cde-5872990737ff_a-d3aca797-6261-38c1-bff9-a590b5de0cbe","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/einhorn-wonder-market-adopted-alternative-paradigm-4qcrtmc","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Yahoo Finance","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/einhorn-wonder-market-adopted-alternative-paradigm-163704878.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/b3471eb9ef2e0679f7c351f7750f0a06","title":"Einhorn: 'We wonder if the market has adopted an alternative paradigm'","summary":"'What if equity value has nothing to do with current or future profits...?'","published_at":1508857277,"content_id":"d3aca797-6261-38c1-bff9-a590b5de0cbe","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/einhorn-wonder-market-adopted-alternative-paradigm-163704878.html","content_published_at":1508863024,"content_relative_time":27,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508869598,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":false},{"text":"Muslims are the first victims of islam.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508877744,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508896502,"comment_relative_time":18,"bot":false},{"text":"See if you\u2019ve heard this, before.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508877744,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508905626,"comment_relative_time":16,"bot":false},{"text":"Trump wants trillions for the rich, after Obama got the economy going.

Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508877744,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508869755,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":false},{"text":"folks, this one is really easy. if we repatriate multi-trillions of $$ that just has to be great for our economy. no more complex than that","message_id":"c57764e3-6e37-4eef-8a67-fa7be952f9b7","context_id":"d3aca797-6261-38c1-bff9-a590b5de0cbe","upvotes":10,"downvotes":12,"reports":0,"replies":11,"author_name":"I&#39;mthinking..","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_I_kl.jpg","author_guid":"O3Y7XBKVG432XOLCMAYFO2ULCA","score":0.49367786904093,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-d0646c50-06d9-3e20-9cde-5872990737ff_a-d3aca797-6261-38c1-bff9-a590b5de0cbe","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/einhorn-wonder-market-adopted-alternative-paradigm-4qcrtmc","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Yahoo Finance","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/einhorn-wonder-market-adopted-alternative-paradigm-163704878.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/b3471eb9ef2e0679f7c351f7750f0a06","title":"Einhorn: 'We wonder if the market has adopted an alternative paradigm'","summary":"'What if equity value has nothing to do with current or future profits...?'","published_at":1508857277,"content_id":"d3aca797-6261-38c1-bff9-a590b5de0cbe","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/einhorn-wonder-market-adopted-alternative-paradigm-163704878.html","content_published_at":1508863024,"content_relative_time":27,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508864092,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":false},{"text":"You are ultimately responsible for your retirement planning and saving\/investing.

The site Retirement And Good Living  provides information on all these issues as well as many other retirement topics and also has several retirement and health calculators.","message_id":"1551078f-79ed-4532-958a-f8716023ce77","context_id":"e4490dbe-8ac3-329a-8b4e-1571cb7d08c3","upvotes":9,"downvotes":1,"reports":1,"replies":1,"author_name":"RetirementSite","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_ald.jpg","author_guid":"NLJHJZUR7GFBGDGZSYNIE7NFZQ","score":0.48811897097666,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-bab2e303-95a1-3c61-b8ce-5663ca9d83cb_a-e4490dbe-8ac3-329a-8b4e-1571cb7d08c3","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/employer-tricking-rescuing-retirement-w5qu28w","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Bloomberg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/employer-tricking-rescuing-retirement-080009543.html","img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/a22cbf38a67b12e021d83e4291ef895b","title":"Your Employer Is Tricking You Into Rescuing Your Retirement","summary":"Actually, it\u2019s more like a good deed, as more 401(k) plans make your inertia work for you instead of against you.","published_at":1508835920,"content_id":"e4490dbe-8ac3-329a-8b4e-1571cb7d08c3","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/employer-tricking-rescuing-retirement-080009543.html","content_published_at":1508832009,"content_relative_time":36,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508878676,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":false},{"text":"Taxes should be used to fund the country, not be part of some social engineering project.

When the couple married in April 2011, the world was introduced to the woman we now know as the duchess of Cambridge, a wife, humanitarian, mother of two, and of course, future queen.
