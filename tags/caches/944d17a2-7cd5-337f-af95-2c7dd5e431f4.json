Members of the BC Wildfire Service were not learning about how to extinguish a fire Wednesday, but about what comes after the flames are doused and the damage is done. \"Essentially, what we're training them to do is identify evidence when they come on scene of a wildfire, ideally how to protect it, and also moving towards getting them to identify the area that the fire originated from, so that we can bring in higher-level trained investigators,\" said Marc Simpson, a wildfire technician with the Coastal Fire Centre. The entry-level investigation course covers a wide range of techniques, including how to spot things as subtle as the angle of char on sticks and branches, the orientation of the foliage around a fire scene and other key pieces of evidence that would be lost to the untrained eye.","published_at":1528335219,"content_id":"c96a256b-cc92-3f4e-b32f-3e6b2a12cc81","content_url":"https:\/\/bc.ctvnews.ca\/investigators-in-training-learn-how-to-trace-origin-of-a-wildfire-collect-evidence-1.3962791","content_published_at":1528334280,"content_time":1528334280,"content_relative_time":14,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-93dd37fa-61bf-3e31-b547-343bd814e81f_a-745b0714-e49c-3ebc-ab91-675d305f0013","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/saskatchewan-municipalities-pay-firefighting-crop-5py707b","author":"nanook","provider":"globalnews.ca","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/4255446\/saskatchewan-municipalities-firefighting-crop-dusters\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/XddgdsKYFeEbWQPGN1Ax6Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/aSEyUOz2fTVHe7sP9Li3dg--\/dz03MjA7aD00MDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_745b0714-e49c-3ebc-ab91-675d305f0013--1161377926.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/O9LgB5S8_jWDsh.EX60gFA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MDU7dz03MjA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/aSEyUOz2fTVHe7sP9Li3dg--\/dz03MjA7aD00MDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_745b0714-e49c-3ebc-ab91-675d305f0013--1161377926.jpeg","height":405,"width":720,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/aSEyUOz2fTVHe7sP9Li3dg--\/dz03MjA7aD00MDU7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_745b0714-e49c-3ebc-ab91-675d305f0013--1161377926.jpeg","imgw":720,"imgh":405,"title":"Saskatchewan municipalities to pay for some firefighting by crop-dusters","summary":"A new Saskatchewan government program allowing crop-duster pilots to fight grass fires will cost $2,000 per plane per hour when air support is called for.
