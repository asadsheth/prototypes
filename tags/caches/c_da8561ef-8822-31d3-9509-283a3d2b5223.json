Our \"2% inflation\" is a laugh because in the real world it is really 8% or more.  And if 8% is the REAL number, in 9 years the price of everything would be twice what things cost today.  If wages only rise by the 2% COLA increases that most employers give (if you're lucky) then you better plan on working til your AT LEAST 70.  This assumed that all your kids are done with school and on their own and you can have 15-20 years to sock away money.  Think about it. If you are now 60 and need $ 1 million to retire today, you'll need $2 million at age 70. So between investments and additional income you'd have to be able to put away an average $100k\/year- just to stay even in terms of standard of living. Now, I've oversimplified, because many of us have paid off mortgages. But many of us refinanced. And most of us are victims of unabated property tax increases and additional taxation that comes with inflation.  The last 10 years of sub-1% interest foisted on us by the Federal Reserve has decimated our \"safe cash\".  It changed the entire retirement picture for those over 50.  The geniuses in Washington have screwed us over and not a whimper in the press.  They'd rather bash Trump for his hair, his hat, his wife, his kids because it's more fun for them.  Sadly, they fail to recognize it they're in the trick-trap with us too.","message_id":"a1469f18-33db-4a9b-9fb1-9f14c4aa9e97","context_id":"29e582f9-9b91-3da5-8ac0-f3aec646a8bd","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Vincent","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_V_ald.jpg","author_guid":"RJNWCFKFMLSN6M3YLOAODDMVIM","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-6df127be-6eb3-3579-89e7-81f36a28c276_a-29e582f9-9b91-3da5-8ac0-f3aec646a8bd","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/personal-finance\/v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-6df127be-6eb3-3579-89e7-81f36a28c276_a-29e582f9-9b91-3da5-8ac0-f3aec646a8bd","author":"nanook","provider":"CNBC","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/suze-orman-says-apos-retirement-154639120.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.cnbc2.com\/63d948370027628d4c17fabbe76d6eaf","title":"Suze Orman says this is the 'new retirement age'","summary":"You may have to work longer than you were planning to, warns personal finance expert Suze Orman.","published_at":1508890108,"content_id":"29e582f9-9b91-3da5-8ac0-f3aec646a8bd","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/suze-orman-says-apos-retirement-154639120.html","content_published_at":1508859999,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Personal Finance","vibe_id":"da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223"},"created_at":1508870225,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":false},{"text":"That b:&;$4 needs to shut up Her 15 min of game are over","message_id":"d6be4bd7-5e03-41f0-80a1-5ca2f12d6d03","context_id":"29e582f9-9b91-3da5-8ac0-f3aec646a8bd","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Rusich","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/6f904d49318fb18e3f774e416e324a86_192.png","author_guid":"3A7D7PO64A2M5KPG4R7BGZ2A2E","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-6df127be-6eb3-3579-89e7-81f36a28c276_a-29e582f9-9b91-3da5-8ac0-f3aec646a8bd","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/personal-finance\/v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-6df127be-6eb3-3579-89e7-81f36a28c276_a-29e582f9-9b91-3da5-8ac0-f3aec646a8bd","author":"nanook","provider":"CNBC","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/suze-orman-says-apos-retirement-154639120.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.cnbc2.com\/63d948370027628d4c17fabbe76d6eaf","title":"Suze Orman says this is the 'new retirement age'","summary":"You may have to work longer than you were planning to, warns personal finance expert Suze Orman.","published_at":1508890108,"content_id":"29e582f9-9b91-3da5-8ac0-f3aec646a8bd","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/suze-orman-says-apos-retirement-154639120.html","content_published_at":1508859999,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Personal Finance","vibe_id":"da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223"},"created_at":1508864145,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":false},{"text":"Why can't she take her own advice and retire already?

First, you need to take care of the mundane details, including shopping for hotel accommodations and plane fares, as well as preparing your itinerary. While these tasks may be tedious, the time spent planning is well worth the effort once you are enjoying your vacation. Developing a financial plan is a similar process. First, you must determine where you want to go and then, how to get there. Otherwise, you may encounter problems or even get financially \u201clost\u201d along the way. However, with a financial road map in hand, you may feel more confident that you are headed in the right direction.
