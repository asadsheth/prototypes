An account with an average ROI of 8%, which is pretty typical, will be worth about $800K after 35 years if you invest $4K annually.  That's 8% of a $50K per year salary (before income tax).  If you are fortunate enough to have an employer that will match, even up to 4%, this can be achieved with $2K a year of your own money, and $2K of theirs.  And again, your $2K is pre-tax, so after income and payroll tax it will only be about $1,600 or so, or about $30 a week out of the bottom line of your paycheck.  If you don't have employer match, it will cost you about $60 a week.  So if you are 29 or younger, and can afford $30-60 a week to invest, you can have nearly $800K by the time you are 65.  And obviously, anytime you get a raise at work, your contribution will go up a little if you keep the same percentage investment, so over time that will add up and be even bigger at the end.  And this accounts for all market fluctuations good and bad over time, barring a disastrous 1929 level crash.  Over time, all the highs and lows will average out...and when the market is low, remember also you are buying low, so dips in the market are not all bad until later on when you are pulling the funds out.  Alot to it on paper, but in practice not that complicated to have a nice chunk of change by retirement time.","message_id":"4f15f430-9718-44f7-8f72-f52f96f0e98c","context_id":"e18d9a69-13b9-35e7-ac15-18c02c78a64e","upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Lon.","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/1dffc7d4bee77e08f7f0bc6286a88cad_192.png","author_guid":"4IDNS6VTOJ4YCXE7UVQN5Z5UHQ","score":0.52753718344348,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-40d53508-3938-3d37-872b-ea565843faf4_a-e18d9a69-13b9-35e7-ac15-18c02c78a64e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/personal-finance\/yes-save-1-million-retirement-28837il","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"CNBC","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/yes-save-1-million-retirement-193003024.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.cnbc2.com\/0c60dbff29995652af01fd2b1650aad4","title":"Yes, you can save $1 million for retirement on a $50,000 salary\u2014here\u2019s how","summary":"Here are the steps you can take to save big without a big paycheck.","published_at":1507750761,"content_id":"e18d9a69-13b9-35e7-ac15-18c02c78a64e","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/yes-save-1-million-retirement-193003024.html","content_published_at":1507750203,"content_relative_time":51,"vibe_name":"Personal Finance","vibe_id":"da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223"},"created_at":1507830293,"comment_relative_time":29,"bot":false},{"text":"The math on this is a bit off....","message_id":"674eccf0-15dd-449b-b5e2-f11b19ef2d89","context_id":"e18d9a69-13b9-35e7-ac15-18c02c78a64e","upvotes":4,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"iversam","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/84b7aecf11b3761cf0c63ec6f3ab19c9_192.jpg","author_guid":"W6QQ6H2KAGNLPRUY6WDOYLH3BE","score":0.51818696077136,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-40d53508-3938-3d37-872b-ea565843faf4_a-e18d9a69-13b9-35e7-ac15-18c02c78a64e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/personal-finance\/yes-save-1-million-retirement-28837il","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"CNBC","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/yes-save-1-million-retirement-193003024.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.cnbc2.com\/0c60dbff29995652af01fd2b1650aad4","title":"Yes, you can save $1 million for retirement on a $50,000 salary\u2014here\u2019s how","summary":"Here are the steps you can take to save big without a big paycheck.","published_at":1507750761,"content_id":"e18d9a69-13b9-35e7-ac15-18c02c78a64e","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/yes-save-1-million-retirement-193003024.html","content_published_at":1507750203,"content_relative_time":51,"vibe_name":"Personal Finance","vibe_id":"da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223"},"created_at":1507778885,"comment_relative_time":43,"bot":false},{"text":"I'm on track for a million and a half by the time I retire, and I only make 37k.
