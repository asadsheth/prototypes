Following a budget is a crucial component of saving money, yet most Americans don't take this easy step. If you've yet to create a budget because you're not sure how, the answer is simple: Just write out all of your monthly expenses, or list them on a spreadsheet, see how much you're spending on each one, add up your costs, and compare that number to the amount you take home in your paychecks. Americans, on a whole, spend more money on housing than any other individual necessity, but if your housing costs exceed 30% of your take-home pay, it could explain why you're struggling to save money.","published_at":1507635588,"content_id":"3d2a96c7-5943-3864-b85f-8dbd20e31a2b","content_url":"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/10\/pf\/not-saving-money\/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29","content_published_at":1507644846,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Personal Finance"},{"post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-38ca2e53-1815-33c6-915a-5b9601e5c1c8_a-663cd657-336b-36b3-a305-734452b40ce6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/personal-finance\/want-retire-comfort-youll-risks-5rt0cl5","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"The Motley Fool","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2017\/10\/10\/want-to-retire-in-comfort-youll-need-to-take-some.aspx?yptr=yahoo","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/fsP6p7XQjDrU1R0q.08swQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_663cd657-336b-36b3-a305-734452b40ce6-459109861.jpeg","title":"Want to Retire in Comfort?

A small number of of wealthier people who are financially able to set aside very large amounts can easily pull an average up. And in fact, they do. If we take a look at the median retirement savings balance -- signifying that half of these households have more saved, and half have less -- it's just $6,200.
