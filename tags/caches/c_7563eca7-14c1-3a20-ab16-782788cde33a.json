We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1508915856,"comment_relative_time":13,"bot":false},{"text":"More over opinionated drivel from Olivia Harvey.","message_id":"79ca7476-503a-40b4-9fca-43ce445a8389","context_id":"daccf8cd-12f3-38e9-9552-89a7ab401f09","upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Nic H","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_NH_ald.jpg","author_guid":"6ALXZQCR3DKACSAS6CQJ6BGS4E","score":0.64841045908534,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-313feb99-420b-37d7-a81d-d6bb25b9288a_a-daccf8cd-12f3-38e9-9552-89a7ab401f09","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-313feb99-420b-37d7-a81d-d6bb25b9288a_a-daccf8cd-12f3-38e9-9552-89a7ab401f09","author":"nanook","provider":"Hello Giggles","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/donald-trump-selling-halloween-maga-170159818.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/hello_giggles_454\/aa94d0728c90bfae08f8d50a7366c12f","title":"Donald Trump is selling Halloween MAGA hats, which is a total disgrace to the holiday and to America","summary":"Donald Trump will likely be one of the most popular costumes you\u2019ll see this Halloween.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1508934349,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":false},{"text":"Title?

The strict following of Wahhabism version of Islam by the Saudi government has created lot of problems for the whole world.  Better late than never.  Turning towards moderate ideas of Islam will make many terrorist activities disappear which means peace and tranquility in the world, and also it will save lots of innocent lives.  This decision by the Saudi government needs to be applauded by all civilized nations.  The money spent on madrasses to train martyrs will be invested for the welfare of people.  This writer just wonders if other Muslim countries supporting jihadi ideology will take a cue from the Saudis and stop assisting fundamentalists and divert their financial resources towards meaningful channels.  I think it will be a good idea if the Saudi government publishes details of its new policy explaining modern Islam - for example, their policy towards stopping Jihadi ideology through mosques and madrasses, equal rights for all genders, freedom of speech and fundamental rights, equal rights for all people practicing different religions etc.","message_id":"b175fa47-ef5b-443a-b2b7-68302ab02054","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":141,"downvotes":13,"reports":0,"replies":26,"author_name":"Dharam","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ald.jpg","author_guid":"FKP6XRHAQXBOIXHF4FJMTMND6Y","score":0.91511831531243,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-84f197e9-c436-3df6-81fb-b0f6f29167bb_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-84f197e9-c436-3df6-81fb-b0f6f29167bb_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","author":"nanook","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/d631b74dcaf6578e0ef456e029892e0e","title":"Saudi Arabia's crown prince promises to lead his country 'back to moderate Islam'","summary":"Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious young crown prince has said he will lead his country back to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d as he announced plans for a vast new \u00a3380 million economic development zone.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed bin Salman told investors gathered in Riyadh that his economic modernisation plans would go hand-in-hand with with political reforms to guide the conservative kingdom away from severe Wahhabi Islam.\u00a0 \"We are returning to what we were before - a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,\" the 32-year-old prince said. \"We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas. We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1508864110,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"Will never happen.

Kuwait isn't Saudi, but the two countries have enough in common that i can assess the plans that the prince is making.  I rate his chance of success as low.  He is squeezed by too many constraints.  He has to get major change before the oil revenue dries up (the world is already starting to turn its back on fossil fuels), which means he needs major change within 30 years or less.  The country has no significant natural resources other than oil, so its only hope will be the hard work and ingenuity of its people.  (Like Singapore, for example.)  But Saudis are not accustomed to hard work, and their education system does not turn out people who are creative and dynamic.  Also, the culture does not encourage innovation.  The religion encourages fatalism and passivity, not a \"can-do\" attitude.  Bringing massive and fundamental change to a culture and to its educational systems is certainly possible - but I don't think it is possible in a mere 30 years.

It is a PURITANICAL form of Islam that insists on an interpretation of the Koran without a metaphor or allegory. Strict Wahhabis believe that all those who don't practice their OWN form of Islam are heathens and enemies. Many non-Wahhabi Sunni or Shia Muslims (non-Arabs) and non-Muslims believe that ship has sailed long ago. The name of the faith has been politicized and used to advance an agenda purposely for their own benefits in Saudi Arabia.","message_id":"622b3ea1-7021-43bb-8da7-84b9e794fb7a","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":10,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"zoom zoom zoom","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_ZZ_kl_2.jpg","author_guid":"3WSZJXQUMC7AJMWFCTSKUZGJXE","score":0.69467045960089,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-84f197e9-c436-3df6-81fb-b0f6f29167bb_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-84f197e9-c436-3df6-81fb-b0f6f29167bb_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","author":"nanook","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/d631b74dcaf6578e0ef456e029892e0e","title":"Saudi Arabia's crown prince promises to lead his country 'back to moderate Islam'","summary":"Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious young crown prince has said he will lead his country back to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d as he announced plans for a vast new \u00a3380 million economic development zone.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed bin Salman told investors gathered in Riyadh that his economic modernisation plans would go hand-in-hand with with political reforms to guide the conservative kingdom away from severe Wahhabi Islam.\u00a0 \"We are returning to what we were before - a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,\" the 32-year-old prince said. \"We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas.

Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1508869755,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":false},{"text":"TL:DR It was platinum jewelry, the price for this rare metal is higher than diamonds.","message_id":"178a3549-fc49-4a1b-acc3-5c8df2821475","context_id":"f726a687-4bc0-3de6-bd3a-f8cc604d7d93","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Bo","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_jl.jpg","author_guid":"TWG6UEH3CVK4CYFHC6XYTVIJPA","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-5c8860c7-30ad-3c5b-9fef-c6ed133277dc_a-f726a687-4bc0-3de6-bd3a-f8cc604d7d93","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/kate-middleton-princess-diana-received-5se4oxk","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"POPSUGAR Fashion","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/fashion\/Kate-Middleton-Engraved-Necklace-Like-Princess-Diana-43861490","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/U.8scCBR.1KraSwzyBLrqw--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f726a687-4bc0-3de6-bd3a-f8cc604d7d93--1164823135.jpeg","title":"Kate Middleton and Princess Diana Received This 1 Piece of Jewelry More Precious Than Diamonds","summary":"Just like the late Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton owns plenty of precious diamond jewels and tiaras.

Diana's circle plate was etched with \"William\" and was a gift from Prince Charles after the birth of their son in 1982.
