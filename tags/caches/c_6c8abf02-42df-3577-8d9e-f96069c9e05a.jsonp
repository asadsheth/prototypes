The consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, was affiliated with the Trump campaign, and that raised questions about whether the 33-year-old billionaire's social network had been used to manipulate voters. Worse, Facebook had known about the data leak\u00a0 three years ago but hadn't bothered to tell anyone.
