The new element has been named Pelosium. Pelosium has one neutron, 12 assistant neutrons, 75 deputy neutrons, and 224 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 311. These particles are held together by dark particles called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons. The symbol of Pelosium is PU. Pelosium's mass actually increases over time, as morons randomly interact with various elements in the atmosphere and become assistant deputy neutrons within the Pelosium molecule, leading to the formation of isodopes. This characteristic of moron-promotion leads some scientist to believe that Pelosium is formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as Critical Morass. When catalyzed with money, Pelosium activates CNNadnausium, an element that radiates orders of magnitude more energy, albeit as incoherent noise, since it has half as many peons but twice as many morons as Pelosium","message_id":"fabb9766-0ff6-4e33-adba-da540556d6b0","context_id":"d7c09202-cfcb-3dea-b35b-74971dcef552","upvotes":94,"downvotes":18,"reports":0,"replies":10,"author_name":"castlerocku","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_C_jl.jpg","author_guid":"DPYAOMBD5QF5T4CCXTNR6XQ4ZQ","score":0.84616506917491,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-d7c09202-cfcb-3dea-b35b-74971dcef552_a-d7c09202-cfcb-3dea-b35b-74971dcef552","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/donald-trump\/v-88cfc604-82db-3595-984d-76ff5706bcff_c-d7c09202-cfcb-3dea-b35b-74971dcef552_a-d7c09202-cfcb-3dea-b35b-74971dcef552","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/george-w-bush-says-america-162409057.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/9f1727114077214bd6b5b8450c3fe315","title":"George W.

Lewinsky used the #MeToo hashtag, which went viral in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.\n\nBroaddrick responded on Thursday, writing on Twitter: \u201cBetter late than never Monica Lewinsky\u2019s ME TOO. I have always felt sad for you, but where were you when we needed you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour silence was deafening in the 90\u2019s when Kathleen, Paula and I needed your voice,\u201d she continued.\n\nBroaddrick was referring to Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones. Willey claims that Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1993 when she served as a White House volunteer. Jones has accused Clinton of exposing himself to her in a Little Rock hotel in 1991, when he served as Arkansas governor.\n\nBill Clinton accusers Kathleen Willey (L), Juanita Broaddrick (C) and rape victim Kathy Shelton are seated for the second presidential debate between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic contender Hillary Clinton at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri on October 9, 2016(MANDEL NGAN\/AFP\/Getty Images)\n\nJones\u2019 lawsuit against Clinton is what led to revelations about the Democrat\u2019s affair with Lewinsky. Broaddrick also came forward during that case, which Clinton settled by paying Jones $800,000.\n\nBroaddrick told her story publicly during an interview with NBC in Feb. 1999. She claimed that when Clinton was serving as Arkansas attorney general, he invited Broaddrick up to his hotel room and forced himself on her.\n\nBroaddrick\u2019s NBC segment aired just after the Senate voted to acquit Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. The network\u2019s decision to hold the interview has been compared to its alleged scuttling of an expose of Weinstein\u2019s sexual misdeeds.\n\nNBC freelance journalist Ronan Farrow claims that an in-depth report he compiled citing several woman who accused Weinstein of raping them was shelved by NBC executives. Farrow published the piece in the New Yorker.","message_id":"6b5cd103-b56d-4f44-9f62-6b5748381019","context_id":"8d6cdfeb-26a8-3e86-8c71-bc8272c08e0c","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_Q_ald_6-25.jpg","author_guid":"DGUM6FJWR3ZJFE2SDVLOYHV3OU","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-8d6cdfeb-26a8-3e86-8c71-bc8272c08e0c_a-8d6cdfeb-26a8-3e86-8c71-bc8272c08e0c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-8d6cdfeb-26a8-3e86-8c71-bc8272c08e0c_a-8d6cdfeb-26a8-3e86-8c71-bc8272c08e0c","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/lindsay-lohan-says-apos-most-151931460.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_huffington_post_584\/f9a4de9e488d4e4e0faabb7d01245172","title":"Lindsay Lohan Says 'Most Women In America' Didn't Care About Her Alleged Abuse","summary":"After defending accused rapist Harvey Weinstein,\u00a0Lindsay Lohan\u00a0claims she didn\u2019t receive any public support from \u201cmost women in America\u201d when she was in an allegedly abusive relationship.","published_at":1508426371,"content_id":"8d6cdfeb-26a8-3e86-8c71-bc8272c08e0c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/lindsay-lohan-says-apos-most-151931460.html","content_published_at":1508426371,"content_relative_time":7,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"NEWSROOM"},"created_at":1508453524,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"Ok so if this is THIS serious. 1) Why isnt it on the image scroller at #1... 2) why is it the 9th down the page with the top being how our brain supposidly survives when we die...????

In every instance the North Korean governments from Kim Il Sung to the present have either renegged on them, outright refused them, or blatantly ignored the print on the paper. It has NEVER been the objective for the North Koreans to have peace on any level in which they are not the masters of the Korean penninsula. They have murdered civilians, kidnapped hundreds if not thousands, purposefully laid booby traps INSIDE South Korea with the sole intent of killing anyone that happened upon them etc etc. Even disregarding what the Kim family has done to the NORTH Korean people it is without a doubt insanely naive to believe there will ever be a peace so long as the North has leaders such as Kim Jong Un. Before anyone insists I am talking out my #$%$ I was there. I walked the DMZ like so many others. I have seen the tunnels the North Koreans built, the booby traps laid, the mines buried in farmers fields etc. Any doubters are welcome to put on the uniform and see duty there. This is no political game. There will be no winners no matter how it comes out. There only be mitigated results. I LIKE the Korean people. I want no war at all on the penninsula, but what I want is meaningless.

My mom\u2019s my stylist extraordinaire and has been my whole life,\u201d Belle tells\u00a0Yahoo Lifestyle at the New York City launch for the new Elizabeth Taylor fragrance, Love & White Diamonds. Channeling Taylor\u2019s old-Hollywood glamour, the 31-year-old actress wore a teal Carolina Herrera tea-length dress with floral embroidery along the bodice and Hayward box clutch. Her brunette locks were tucked into a faux bob,\u00a0and winged eyeliner accentuated her doe-shaped eyes. Belle completed her look with a spritz of Love & White Diamonds, which she says boasts a \u201cfresh, not too heavy, and floral\u201d scent that can be worn both day and night. Belle\u2019s mother is Brazilian-born former fashion designer Deborah Gould. So, of course, she knows a thing or two about which silhouettes and shades work best for her daughter. Gould has outfitted her offspring in ladylike gowns with eclectic patterns, tailored black pantsuits, and vibrant printed frocks \u2014 all head-turning ensembles. Check out some of Camilla Belle\u2019s most recent red-carpet moments and see exactly why her mama gets it right every single time.

Channeling Taylor\u2019s old-Hollywood glamour, the 31-year-old actress wore a teal Carolina Herrera tea-length dress with floral embroidery along the bodice and Hayward box clutch. Her brunette locks were tucked into a faux bob,\u00a0and winged eyeliner accentuated her doe-shaped eyes. Belle completed her look with a spritz of Love & White Diamonds, which she says boasts a \u201cfresh, not too heavy, and floral\u201d scent that can be worn both day and night. Belle\u2019s mother is Brazilian-born former fashion designer Deborah Gould. So, of course, she knows a thing or two about which silhouettes and shades work best for her daughter. Gould has outfitted her offspring in ladylike gowns with eclectic patterns, tailored black pantsuits, and vibrant printed frocks \u2014 all head-turning ensembles.
