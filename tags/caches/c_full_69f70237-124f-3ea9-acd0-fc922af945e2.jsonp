We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d.

Turning towards moderate ideas of Islam will make many terrorist activities disappear which means peace and tranquility in the world, and also it will save lots of innocent lives.  This decision by the Saudi government needs to be applauded by all civilized nations.  The money spent on madrasses to train martyrs will be invested for the welfare of people.  This writer just wonders if other Muslim countries supporting jihadi ideology will take a cue from the Saudis and stop assisting fundamentalists and divert their financial resources towards meaningful channels.

He has to get major change before the oil revenue dries up (the world is already starting to turn its back on fossil fuels), which means he needs major change within 30 years or less.  The country has no significant natural resources other than oil, so its only hope will be the hard work and ingenuity of its people.  (Like Singapore, for example.)  But Saudis are not accustomed to hard work, and their education system does not turn out people who are creative and dynamic.  Also, the culture does not encourage innovation.  The religion encourages fatalism and passivity, not a \"can-do\" attitude.  Bringing massive and fundamental change to a culture and to its educational systems is certainly possible - but I don't think it is possible in a mere 30 years.
