That said, invoking Allah\u2019s name during murder is despicable.\n\nKilling innocent people you never met is pure evil! Regrettably, that is exactly what a 29-year-old Uzbek man did in New York City, leaving eight dead and a dozen injured behind. Muslims are commanded by the Qur\u2019an to do good and avoid evil.
