lobby AIPAC that has choked the fabric of our nation through foreign policy decisions and unwavering support for Israel, thus the cause of muslim hatred towards us... Paul Findley, Cynthia McKinney and James Traficant had their careers destroyed for speaking out against the Jews, these are true Americans that put America first ! Read what Walt and Mearsheimer wrote about \"The Israel Lobby\". Wanted by none and hated by all... they've never have assimilated but, have pushed massive immigration and multi-culturalism while staying segregated and insulated themselves. Instead they have managed to control all forms of finance, commerce, media and politics feeding off the host until the carcass dies and they're kicked out... again, then moving on as the euro trash nomads have done throughout history ! The enemy within creating strife and division while silently remaining in the shadows and enjoying the aftermath ! Drain the Kosher swamp and put America first then, deport all treasonous dual Israeli citizens in the congress and senate to the rogue nation they pledge allegiance to before us... finally all bribed AIPAC politicians held on charges of treason !!! Before Israel we had no enemies in the Middle East... No more wars for Zionists !","message_id":"5806a47a-04cf-405c-817e-da999c670663","context_id":"fb2b4d3b-6566-34b1-a35f-059590b22b7c","upvotes":12,"downvotes":16,"reports":0,"replies":9,"author_name":"True Blue","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_TB_ald.jpg","author_guid":"HQFH4YNDUYZNHLWCCGE44A7SKA","score":0.47504206106885,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-168e91b8-5dd1-3228-9632-f2bfa8c982d2_a-fb2b4d3b-6566-34b1-a35f-059590b22b7c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/trump-expected-apos-decertify-apos-66wz810","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-expected-apos-decertify-apos-090054677.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_huffington_post_584\/c1b8fb548a75cc02349449837093082e","title":"Trump Will 'Decertify' The Iran Deal, Punt The Issue To Congress","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump is expected to announce on Friday afternoon that he is decertifying the Iran nuclear agreement, the 2015 accord signed by the U.S., Iran and five other nations.","published_at":1507924215,"content_id":"fb2b4d3b-6566-34b1-a35f-059590b22b7c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-expected-apos-decertify-apos-090054677.html","content_published_at":1507885254,"content_relative_time":14,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2"},"created_at":1507888911,"comment_relative_time":13,"bot":false},{"text":"Trump is very dangerous.\nHe plays with the nation of America","message_id":"c140f2a6-38a9-4f56-8a86-babd68f4df92","context_id":"fb2b4d3b-6566-34b1-a35f-059590b22b7c","upvotes":3,"downvotes":4,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"abbas","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_A_kl_2_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"WJ6ZW3EFS2JBXX2EN5IKRT744U","score":0.43332396417969,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-168e91b8-5dd1-3228-9632-f2bfa8c982d2_a-fb2b4d3b-6566-34b1-a35f-059590b22b7c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/trump-expected-apos-decertify-apos-66wz810","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-expected-apos-decertify-apos-090054677.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_huffington_post_584\/c1b8fb548a75cc02349449837093082e","title":"Trump Will 'Decertify' The Iran Deal, Punt The Issue To Congress","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump is expected to announce on Friday afternoon that he is decertifying the Iran nuclear agreement, the 2015 accord signed by the U.S., Iran and five other nations.","published_at":1507924215,"content_id":"fb2b4d3b-6566-34b1-a35f-059590b22b7c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-expected-apos-decertify-apos-090054677.html","content_published_at":1507885254,"content_relative_time":14,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2"},"created_at":1507906174,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":false},{"text":"If he really wanted to stick it to Iran, he could stop propping up Assad and Hezbollah in Syria.
