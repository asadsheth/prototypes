A word of advice is for the players to find another way to protest ,and to  explain in detail what you are protesting about.","message_id":"5210bb02-b8ed-44b0-8868-6a75b2a000bb","context_id":"a5fa0fcf-d2c8-35ca-8a34-d3fd546b78e8","upvotes":514,"downvotes":21,"reports":0,"replies":25,"author_name":"john o","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"JOMB5AQNJ46CD5QJCKQCB6GXIE","score":0.96234947825228,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-110a9e34-b2c8-11e5-9dd2-fa163e2c24a6_c-2bb9ec24-dc06-3599-a98f-922f116a48a7_a-a5fa0fcf-d2c8-35ca-8a34-d3fd546b78e8","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nfl\/russell-okung-urges-players-band-8jbroeo","author":"third_watch","provider":"ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/russell-okung-urges-players-band-134633342.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/ded60a84fb8d7ac9bc76573e9178c0fb","title":"Russell Okung urges players to band together against NFL, Trump\u2019s anthem pressure","summary":"If the NFL and its team owners think players are just going to go along quietly with whatever they decide to make their national anthem problem go away, they could be in for a bit o a surprise.

We do it because you play ball until the play is over and it's good fundamental baseball. That's how I was taught to play way back in the 70's.

All these news articles reference an incident that happened in 1997 that resulted in a payoff. Now a lot of people are assuming that was the rape that she has accused him of. However; this leads to more questions. In 2009 she appeared in a Weinstein movie directed by her boyfriend Robert Rodriguez called Planet Terror. So either he raped her in 1997 and she was okay enough to work on a movie of his in 2008 or he did something to her in 1997 for which he paid her off and then raped her in 2008. See the problem here?

As far as replay goes I was initially against it, but have warmed up to it.  Replay forces these guys to be more fundamental with slides, tags, foot-on-base, etc.  Just because the ball beats the runner, the defender still needs to apply the proper tag.  In last nights case, the runner should slide and stay on the base.  That's the rule.  If your not on the base and you are tagged, you're out.  As far as holding the tag in case the runner pops off the bag, infielders have been doing this for years, way before replay.  The so called \"neighborhood\" play? That \"neighborhood\" thing used to award a bad throw from a middle infielder.  Again, replay has reigned in the fact that you must have your foot on the bag when you make a force play.

I can, however, see where many would think that actresses have no set morals when many will display themselves in the nude for money on the movie screen and yet scream they aren't respected or that they are objectified? They can call it a form of art in retrospect, but do they really respect themselves if they sell their nudity for money and yet want to be honored or respected as morally proper? Weinstein was dead wrong for trying to force himself on women, but women must decide not to play Hollywood's game and participate in the acting profession by using acting talent rather than nudity to gain fame.","message_id":"1d6e6745-c1f2-42d8-93fc-6ee7f8f1d526","context_id":"dbd3ab81-df44-33da-bfbf-9be7555fb8a4","upvotes":11,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Retired guy","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/7d7f35fd7443e3973230ab5ef5500118_192.jpeg","author_guid":"6Y2CLQLCQ6FCGFOCNKPYO3WOBY","score":0.81254087307037,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-b6fa400a-758e-3fd0-a945-fee5af2bbd7e_a-dbd3ab81-df44-33da-bfbf-9be7555fb8a4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-b6fa400a-758e-3fd0-a945-fee5af2bbd7e_a-dbd3ab81-df44-33da-bfbf-9be7555fb8a4","author":"nanook","provider":"People","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/tom-hanks-doesn-apos-t-165344783.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/people_218\/c020d8cf6bf299b5f6a0d0dbd210dc8c","title":"Tom Hanks Doesn't Buy Harvey Weinstein's Response to Sexual Assault Allegations: I Grew Up in the '60s and '70s Too","summary":"Tom Hanks Blasts Harvey Weinstein Sexual Harassment Apology","published_at":1507898834,"content_id":"dbd3ab81-df44-33da-bfbf-9be7555fb8a4","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/tom-hanks-doesn-apos-t-165344783.html","content_published_at":1507827224,"content_relative_time":30,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1507854579,"comment_relative_time":22,"bot":false},{"text":"Media is always telling us this is the most happiest lifestyle ever.

Here, however, there are allegations that Weinstein settled 8 potential law suits by paying his accusers large amounts of money.  Assuming that is true, that would give anyone more than enough basis to conclude that Weinstein was guilty of sexual misconduct, be it harassment, abuse, sexual assault, or all of the above.  As to Stone's statement that \"it's not easy what he's going through,\"  that is true of anyone accused of misconduct, civil or criminal.  That's an inevitable part of the legal system, someone gets accused or sued and if the case proceeds to trial, the accuser must have evidence to prove the allegations and the person accused has the right but also the burden of defending himself or herself.  Assuming Weinstein has settled numerous cases involving misconduct, including possibly sexual assault, why would Stone make a point of expressing sympathy for him?  It's enough to remind people that as to possible criminal charges, he is presumed innocent. That doesn't mean anyone should feel sorry for him whatsoever.  At least as to the statement reported on, Stone expresses no sympathy whatsoever for the victims.  Further, he seems to present some sort of defense of Weinstein's conduct on the grounds that is it pervasive in Hollywood.  Well, that's precisely why this is an important matter.  An institution like Hollywood, that plays such an influential role in defining our culture, has an enormous responsibility to society not to transmit the cynicism which Weinstein's behavior represents.  I for one don't believe that a corrupt person or a corrupt institution can, in the long run, communicate positive human values.

The \"little horn\" or kingdom \"came up among them\"the 10 horns which were the kingdoms of Western Europe (Daniel 7:8). So it would be a little kingdom somewhere in Western Europe.\n\nB. It would have a man at its head who could speak for it (Daniel 7:8).\n\nC. It would pluck up or uproot three kingdoms (Daniel 7:8).\n\nD. It would be \"diverse\" or different from the other 10 kingdoms (Daniel 7:24).\n\nE. It would make war with and \"wear out\" or persecute the saints (Daniel 7:21, 25).\n\nF. It would emerge from the pagan Roman empire, the fourth world kingdom (Daniel 7:7, 8).\n\nG. God's people (the saints) would \"be given into his hand\" for \"a time and times and the dividing of time\" (Daniel 7:25).\n\nH. It would \"speak great words against\" or blaspheme God (Daniel 7:25). In Revelation 13:5, the Bible says the same power speaks \"great things and blasphemies.\"\n\nI. It would \"think to change times and laws.\" Daniel 7:25.\n\nDon't forget all these identification points come directly from the Bible. They are not some human opinion or speculation. Historians could tell you quickly what power is being described.

That includes automated belts that feed bags into the x-ray screening machine and an automated bin returner that provides\u00a0a constant supply of containers.","published_at":1507898905,"content_id":"8e5f2a34-bf23-3b02-8a7c-af6d0951ddc3","content_url":"http:\/\/www.dallasnews.com\/business\/dfw-airport\/2017\/10\/12\/new-automated-security-lanes-dfw-airportcould-make-next-trip-breeze","content_published_at":1507848360,"content_relative_time":24,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10_c-f2ddd887-4db0-3025-a42e-d70268e8038a_a-e378aac8-8966-3183-9b41-6eabc748a744","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/transportation\/tesla-other-electric-cars-win-30whp9b","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"The Cheat Sheet","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cheatsheet.com\/money-career\/if-electric-cars-win-heres-how-much-oil-companies-lose.html\/?ref=YF&yptr=yahoo","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/wscs.com\/001f170510a6d2154ed16820f41a26d8","title":"If Electric Cars Take Over, Here\u2019s How Much Oil Companies Will Lose","summary":"If Americans use less gasoline to drive, oil corporations stand to lose a great deal.

Its imminent demise has been predicted many times before. It is a wonder it survived the fall of the Roman Empire, but it did. Educated opinion in Europe was sure that it was over around the time of the French Revolution, that the then-current pope would be the last. But he was not. Although Europe did largely abandon the Church after WWI, it has spread like wildfire in Africa over the last century, so that now its spiritual center of gravity is there. \n\nDan Brown has done and continues to do considerable damage to the Church. His wildly popular fiction is considered to be historical narrative, although he himself explicitly denies at he is writing history. His books are riddled with half-truths and flat-out lies which he claims he has no responsibility to defend because of his disclaimer that he is writing fiction, not history. Still, people who know nothing of the history think he is telling the truth. \n\nBut Dan Brown will be long gone in 100 years. The Church?

Bill Clinton was the exact same type of man, but liberals never really condemed him, and Hillary enabled him.  He still gets paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for speaking events.  Hillary was able to run for president, and again, nothing form the left about sexual harrasment and abuse, or the enablers of it. Somehow millions of American women were perfectly ok with Hillary, and didn't seem to feel a need to have a \"women's march\" against either her or Bill, when both of them were either as bad as Weinstein himself (Bill), or as bad as his enablers (Hillary).  Yet all of these outraged liberals over Weinstein were Hillary supporters.  While they were right to condemn trump for his comments, they are truely blind when it comes to their own flock, and the normalcy they've been promoting for decades.  Even the slow reaction time from left leaning late night comics, shows the extrodinary blind spot they have.  As long as you're a member of the left, liberals suddenly become blind to the racisim, sexisim, and sexual abuse being promoted and perpetuated right in front of them, by members of their own tribe.

For months, government watchdog groups have clamored and filed lawsuits for information on who is visiting the president's estate in South Florida while he's there, only to come up largely empty-handed.

Hurricane Irma, a Category 5 nightmare come alive, skirted north of Puerto Rico on Wednesday, battering but not decimating the U.S. territory, to the relief of its 3 million-plus residents.

Addressing the extent of St. Maarten's devastation, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomba told AFP: \u201cWe know that the four most solid buildings on the island have been destroyed, which means that more rustic structures have probably been completely or partially destroyed.\u201d It seems, in the least, the Trump Organization will have to spend a hefty sum on L\u00ea Chateau repairs.","published_at":1504884449,"content_id":"055d6974-8f2b-3bbc-a2b8-25ca4ba583a2","content_url":"https:\/\/www.gq.com\/story\/trump-mar-a-lago-hurricane-insurance","content_published_at":1504802771,"content_relative_time":870,"vibe_name":"Mar-a-Lago","vibe_id":"93c20339-94e8-3bc1-92a6-69efcfe7df32"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":870,"bot":true}])
