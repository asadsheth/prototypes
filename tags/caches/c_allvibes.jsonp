On the other hand, if you protect Social Security and provide Universal Health Care for all. The results are much much greater. What is wrong with helping citizens for the greater good of all. Many of our citizens are hungry, have no housing and are ill. What are you Republicans willing to do about that. It appears you are all suffering from contagious mental illness.","message_id":"89580edf-a3ad-4313-a076-62722144ecba","context_id":"a54de0f0-a6e6-335c-b7e3-e9cacb43fded","upvotes":17,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Herman","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_H_kl_2_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"HJUUM55K3B7XECHCZCRGN3X5GY","score":0.81079321903524,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-a8d1656d-768a-3639-9956-703e098ee4cb_a-a54de0f0-a6e6-335c-b7e3-e9cacb43fded","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-a8d1656d-768a-3639-9956-703e098ee4cb_a-a54de0f0-a6e6-335c-b7e3-e9cacb43fded","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"CNBC","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/sen-bob-corker-apos-ridiculous-124203627.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/cnbc.com\/5b225e401f89659d901d8c5db61766a0","title":"Sen.

Kellogg's were quick to respond to Ahmed's tweet, apologising and saying that the artwork would be \"updated and in stores soon.\" Kellogg is committed to diversity & inclusion.

Profit margins are only partially affected by capital investment. Capital investments are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives. So, sinking your profits back into the business will cause the assets on the balance sheet to go up and then they take depreciation on those assets. So, only a portion of the capital expenditure hits the income statement every year. It's pretty obvious what they are doing. They are selling goods at near cost (hence the low profit margin) to gain market share. It's kind of what the japanese did in the eighties. Dump goods on the market at cost to drive competition out of business and then control the market. That's why nearly every electronic device was from Japan after the eighties until the Koreans and Chinese were able to under cut the Japanese manufacturers. \n\nThey are making no profits from consumer goods sales and their profit comes from the AWS unit.","message_id":"3c1886b9-1cca-447d-9092-6aeb0d0bd1a1","context_id":"b44a83a0-0dd8-32c2-96db-763af3768679","upvotes":1,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"ym73","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_Y_jl.jpg","author_guid":"ZYBUHUUZKA4OBQQM5VK5H64BGU","score":0.30839827784507,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-f5f74723-02af-3dcc-9332-41e301487f61_a-b44a83a0-0dd8-32c2-96db-763af3768679","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/amazons-bold-spending-closely-watched-6alj1f2","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/amazons-bold-spending-closely-watched-140134752.html","img":"http:\/\/d.yimg.com\/hd\/yahoofinance\/2\/7\/b27dd040be4c97019127bbf7912b3595_TNsoC5mWNF8CNqEa-Ap7oCVjlVsLqmJs0w5Fq1V1OupX8QKL6Tgc5i-HdXP7DmUZ6bs5xwnVs3o-~A_2_0.jpg?s=f2c879c7c114466a82160deac5e4eb1c&c=dcd44cb6d1fbecad7160f68eb8eae25c&a=yahoofinance&mr=0","title":"Amazon sales surge after Whole Foods acquisition, busy Prime Day","summary":"Amazon is winning business from older, big box rivals by delivering virtually any product to customers at a low cost, and at times faster than it takes to buy goods from a physical store.

Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue. Among Republicans surveyed, 63 percent said deficit reduction should take priority over tax cuts for corporations, while 75 percent said deficit reduction should take priority over tax cuts for the wealthy.","published_at":1508931685,"content_id":"a91a8129-862d-3f6b-96af-5eae03e08e53","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/fewer-third-americans-back-trump-tax-plan-reuters-192750092--business.html","content_published_at":1508873310,"content_relative_time":68,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508929450,"comment_relative_time":53,"bot":false},{"text":".02%..... is NOT slipping","message_id":"b9d770d6-102d-4091-91c3-863759702a69","context_id":"9d2d8218-e82f-3dae-8a31-fbee5acb9fc4","upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Mark","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_M_ald.jpg","author_guid":"4DT6HVUGFRDJ4GXIEIK23L4SAI","score":0.64841045908534,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-7d488fcb-e808-34bb-b4c0-37aa1a768a16_a-9d2d8218-e82f-3dae-8a31-fbee5acb9fc4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/us-stocks-snapshot-wall-st-3qk5pue","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/us-stocks-snapshot-wall-st-133220361.html","img":null,"title":"US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall St slips at the open on tepid earnings","summary":"Wall Street slipped at the open on Wednesday as the U.S. corporate earnings season hit its peak, with a handful of companies reporting lackluster results.

Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue. Among Republicans surveyed, 63 percent said deficit reduction should take priority over tax cuts for corporations, while 75 percent said deficit reduction should take priority over tax cuts for the wealthy.","published_at":1508931685,"content_id":"a91a8129-862d-3f6b-96af-5eae03e08e53","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/fewer-third-americans-back-trump-tax-plan-reuters-192750092--business.html","content_published_at":1508873310,"content_relative_time":68,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508903038,"comment_relative_time":60,"bot":false},{"text":"McDonald's is poisonous new world order slop.","message_id":"8415026a-533b-414c-ae20-281d744e50e1","context_id":"976dbd53-0f0c-3d4e-b15d-adade8143a9f","upvotes":6,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Planetofapes","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/5c40b7027f62107d721e36850eb0685f_192.png","author_guid":"R6EGGVVVWPQDMBHFS5N7TTZR4I","score":0.63286794713747,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-576946a3-9bdb-3dc9-b001-04a340a4c30e_a-976dbd53-0f0c-3d4e-b15d-adade8143a9f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/remember-mcdonald-apos-dollar-menu-1o0op4o","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Fortune","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/remember-mcdonald-apos-dollar-menu-045715368.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/video\/video.fortune.time.com\/63c67fb1fc978ea7f500acba704d65ea","title":"Remember the McDonald's Dollar Menu?

Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue. Among Republicans surveyed, 63 percent said deficit reduction should take priority over tax cuts for corporations, while 75 percent said deficit reduction should take priority over tax cuts for the wealthy.","published_at":1508931685,"content_id":"a91a8129-862d-3f6b-96af-5eae03e08e53","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/fewer-third-americans-back-trump-tax-plan-reuters-192750092--business.html","content_published_at":1508873310,"content_relative_time":68,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508934644,"comment_relative_time":51,"bot":false},{"text":"China Atheist?

Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue.

Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue.

That is to say, the PRC does indeed advocate \"state-atheism,\" but the reason authorities are increasingly cracking down on religious movements has much more to do with controlling subsets of the population who might be inspired or compelled to action (including, at least potentially, dissidence) by an ideology more than that of China's official \"communist\" principles (and of course that label is problematic given that many zones in China actually have less regulation and more private enterprise than most nominally capitalist countries). So when one considers the crackdown on Falun Gong (which continues to this day, but started almost 20 years ago directly because of a political protest by Falun Gong members), this renewed attempt to control religious practice in China is far, far more about retaining and enhancing political power for the PRC Communist Party and quashing any resistance than any atheist ideological platform.","message_id":"2c5a3c32-1798-453e-b3e2-7f8e381e5d4a","context_id":"2139c2bc-4a66-3a11-926b-55f1641e456c","upvotes":0,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"United!!","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/17c01f21c8db4c5ba55987b1cb1904ac_192.jpg","author_guid":"MPBHQXJJNO5E5QRXML23W3VASA","score":0.21490368384659,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-5cf27f9e-774a-3b93-b7e1-e3b28c86466c_a-2139c2bc-4a66-3a11-926b-55f1641e456c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-5cf27f9e-774a-3b93-b7e1-e3b28c86466c_a-2139c2bc-4a66-3a11-926b-55f1641e456c","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/communist-china-president-xi-jinping-162254184.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/1b76943a83a959838c1044e0ea016b73","title":"Communist China President Xi Jinping Now Wants to Control Religion Too","summary":"Communist, atheist China wants to make the country\u2019s many religions, including Catholicism and Islam, more Chinese, President Xi Jinping declared during a marathon speech at his party\u2019s conference.
