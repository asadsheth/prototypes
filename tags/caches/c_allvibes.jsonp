In the video above, we explore the history of Xenogears, including some behind-the-scenes details and a look at what made it special. With a twist on the Active Time Battle system used in games like Chrono Trigger, it offered a distinct style of combat to go along with an excellent soundtrack.

Cyprus-based Neurogaming is a joint endeavor made up of Wargaming \u2014 the publisher behind World of Tanks \u2014 and a venture funding group called VRTech. Together, this group is developing a number of VR titles alongside cloud services and hardware packages designed so operators can easily set up and run their own VR arcades. It is still early for the group, but they are focusing more heavily than other solutions I've seen on one critical aspect of an alluring VR attraction: hooking people to come back with a quality competitive gaming experience.","published_at":1519528103,"content_id":"4ba2d4a6-8867-35fb-97e3-bbff32494ca9","content_url":"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2018\/02\/24\/neurogamings-world-of-tanks-vr-attraction-reminds-us-that-arcades-are-social-experiences\/","content_published_at":1519527836,"content_time":1519527836,"content_relative_time":62,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":62,"comment_relative_time":62,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"ea3a6c6e-d1c8-3b82-89f2-abe95dd42058","post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-e4e79368-50dd-335a-bc0b-15405b72d06a_a-ea3a6c6e-d1c8-3b82-89f2-abe95dd42058","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-e4e79368-50dd-335a-bc0b-15405b72d06a_a-ea3a6c6e-d1c8-3b82-89f2-abe95dd42058","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/square-enix-toy-fair-2018-236u0xz","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"technobuffalo.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.technobuffalo.com\/2018\/02\/24\/square-enix-toy-fair-2018\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/VI5BjOnUAOetxRB8sJc9Fg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/s46iRPHt5ZaRRhilpki_rg--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9MTA2Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ea3a6c6e-d1c8-3b82-89f2-abe95dd42058-295740750.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/fIHVxQP_mTnMWczBE4dgfQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDY3O3c9MTYwMDs-\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/s46iRPHt5ZaRRhilpki_rg--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9MTA2Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ea3a6c6e-d1c8-3b82-89f2-abe95dd42058-295740750.jpeg","height":1067,"width":1600,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/s46iRPHt5ZaRRhilpki_rg--\/dz0xNjAwO2g9MTA2Nzt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ea3a6c6e-d1c8-3b82-89f2-abe95dd42058-295740750.jpeg","imgw":1600,"imgh":1067,"title":"Square Enix at Toy Fair 2018 \u2013 A comics heavy year","summary":"Square Enix was in attendance at Toy Fair 2018, and so were its display cases that give me nightmares for a full year after trying to shoot photography through them.

The Super NT is the culmination of these efforts: a 99-percent-accurate recreation of the Super Nintendo in a consumer-friendly package. Analogue achieves this magic via field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Nearly all purpose-built consoles, including Nintendo's own SNES Mini, run retro games through software emulation, which means they're using a program to simulate the original Super Nintendo. But FPGA is an integrated circuit that is coded to recreate the architecture of the original Super Nintendo hardware itself.
