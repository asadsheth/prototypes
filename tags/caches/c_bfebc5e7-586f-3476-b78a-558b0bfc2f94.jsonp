It has been a tough road, but getting out of high school was a virtual godsend to my son. They had no idea what to do with him, because he is not autistic nor does he have an obvious impediment to learning, so they put him here, they put him there, and nothing worked. Out on his own, he started to do things on his own. We got him into a program specifically for young adults with such problems, and he holds down a job. He still is socially inactive, but he is in another program that we hope helps him to be more social. He has no real friends, but we hope that this is simply another mountain that he has to conquer, and we really believe that he will. Public schools are not equipped to handle people like this, even though we so want them to be. I wish there had been some alternative to his schooling, but there wasn't. I have found my son to be smart, quite literate and yes, just discovering the world he lives in. I know that he is going to make it, but the road is a long one.
