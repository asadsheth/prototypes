The crash sparked a brush fire that had grown to about 20 acres shortly after nightfall. Officials were not able to confirm what aircraft was down, but a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said the agency got a report of an Extra EA 300 plane with two people onboard missing from a flight from Gillespie Field in El Cajon. Sheriff's and California Highway Patrol officials said 911 callers in the Lakeside area reported the possible crash east of El Monte Road about 4:20 p.m. Some callers said they didn't","published_at":1508649373,"content_id":"3e2bfae2-35d7-3de6-97dd-8c83d4b28eb7","content_url":"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/local\/lanow\/la-me-ln-sd-plane-crash-20171021-story.html","content_published_at":1508649000,"content_relative_time":107,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":107,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-088b7488-6716-3e87-9244-845c574c7bc4_a-f6733d9a-6acb-3663-bc5b-8d6395ee7c12","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/french-authorities-corsica-wildfires-under-control-357tgw0","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/french-authorities-corsica-wildfires-under-control-080647089.html","img":null,"title":"French authorities get Corsica wildfires under control","summary":"PARIS (AP) \u2014 French authorities say firefighters have mostly contained wildfires that spread across the Mediterranean island of Corsica over the weekend.","published_at":1508742648,"content_id":"f6733d9a-6acb-3663-bc5b-8d6395ee7c12","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/french-authorities-corsica-wildfires-under-control-080647089.html","content_published_at":1508746007,"content_relative_time":80,"vibe_name":"Wildfires","vibe_id":"944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":80,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-944d17a2-7cd5-337f-af95-2c7dd5e431f4_c-fbebc37e-884e-332d-994b-178ac2efa1bc_a-81cb35a3-ee03-317d-b015-a55c46c61eee","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/wildfires\/alberta-researcher-says-climate-change-o70d16j","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"globalnews.ca","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/3818299\/alberta-researcher-says-climate-change-contributes-to-more-extreme-wildfires\/","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zCN4duiYH3BLGH.1E50mDg--\/dz03MjA7aD00ODA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_81cb35a3-ee03-317d-b015-a55c46c61eee-1627114984.jpeg","title":"Alberta researcher says climate change contributes to 'more extreme' wildfires","summary":"Climate change didn't directly cause major wildfires in Alberta and British Columbia this year but it did contribute to their extreme nature, says a University of Alberta researcher. B.C. recorded its worst-ever fire season. Wildfires that began in early April scorched just over 12,000 square kilometres of timber, bush and grassland and at their height forced 45,000 people from their homes. Last month, Waterton Lakes National Park was evacuated after lightning sparked a blaze just inside the B.C. boundary. The flames eventually crossed into the park in southwestern Alberta.

The climate and geography of the Golden State makes it the largest firepit in the continental U.S. With or without its 40 million people to intervene, it will burn, but there are some sensible actions that can reduce the strength of fires before they start.
