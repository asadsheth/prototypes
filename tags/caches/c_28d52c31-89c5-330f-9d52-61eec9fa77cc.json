You might call this one the \u201cGreat American Occultation,\u201d as it takes a similar track to a certain total solar eclipse and another occultation of the bright star Aldebaran earlier this year. The Moon is a 20% illuminated waning crescent during Sunday's occultation, about the best phase for such an event, as you'll also get a nice contrasting Earthshine or Ashen light on dark nighttime limb of the Moon.","published_at":1507827155,"content_id":"0fb75d60-8d34-355f-bb90-00adbec11782","content_url":"https:\/\/www.universetoday.com\/137426\/tales-king-watch-moon-occults-regulus-north-america-weekend\/","content_published_at":1507823113,"content_relative_time":31,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":31,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-65fe79c1-a8fd-3c96-89bd-0c11e286016d_a-56f662c5-4f6a-3c88-94a9-16166f6959b2","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/therell-something-eye-watch-kids-28bwpn8","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Sploid","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sploid.gizmodo.com\/therell-be-something-in-your-eye-as-you-watch-these-kid-1819396075?utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_twitter&utm_source=gizmodo_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/P66aaqhGDUlgvROnr8x.eA--\/dz04MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_56f662c5-4f6a-3c88-94a9-16166f6959b2--1838108671.jpeg","title":"There'll Be Something in Your Eye as You Watch These Kids Experience Zero-Gravity","summary":"In August, eight children living with disabilities were given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience zero gravity. The experience was made possible by the European Space Agency, and Novespace, a subsidiary of CNES which is France's version of NASA. The kids, joined by astronauts from the UK, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy, rode a converted Airbus A310 which flew in repeated parabolic arcs to simulate the effects of zero-gravity without having to visit space. In addition to simply floating, which itself must be an amazing feeling and experience, the kids and the astronauts performed various experiments, including lighting candles to see what a flame does in zero-G, and playing ping-pong with water drops.","published_at":1507827023,"content_id":"56f662c5-4f6a-3c88-94a9-16166f6959b2","content_url":"https:\/\/sploid.gizmodo.com\/therell-be-something-in-your-eye-as-you-watch-these-kid-1819396075?utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_twitter&utm_source=gizmodo_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow","content_published_at":1507825440,"content_relative_time":30,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":true},{"text":"Here is the link ---https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/mission_pages\/juno\/images\/index.html","message_id":"7662e244-86c0-4397-8636-928223fe0183","context_id":"7fdb7df6-7fa6-3aec-b27d-bc39b6e0608f","upvotes":10,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Rick","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_nl.jpg","author_guid":"BVPNNYQKYVF6CQONCHLTGGUOGQ","score":0.76153220372494,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-228b626c-6551-35b1-a345-fc6e1fe5a84b_a-7fdb7df6-7fa6-3aec-b27d-bc39b6e0608f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/sagan-39-awe-inspiring-photos-3qdzgwm","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Digital Trends","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/sagan-39-awe-inspiring-photos-234513431.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/digital_trends_973\/a24abfe92fba62137f4bdf589fafbc2f","title":"Get your Sagan on with 50 awe-inspiring photos of the final frontier","summary":"Few things instill a sense of wonder quite like the final frontier.
