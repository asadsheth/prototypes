While he called for a renewed emphasis on exploration, he also said the council, designed to help guide U.S. policy in space, would need to create a more robust national security response to advancements made by Russia and China in developing \"jamming and hacking\" capabilities that can \"cripple\" military and intelligence satellites.

The comet is bright enough that for most of this month, you should be able to see it with a small telescope or a good pair of binoculars. Be aware that it will look blurrier than a star does (you'll know you're onto something if you have trouble convincing your binoculars to focus\u00a0on it), and it may also show a greenish tinge, according to Space.com. The comet has also caused a bit of a political stir, with the\u00a0astronomers who discovered it saying that the International Astronomical Union, which oversees the official names of everything in space, had declined to include\u00a0the acronym of the discovering instruments in the comet's name.","published_at":1507651227,"content_id":"33feb911-7df8-37f4-a4a6-35be3fd775e4","content_url":"http:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/asas-sn1-new-comet-night-sky-and-you-can-see-it-october-680875?utm_campaign=NewsweekTwitter&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social","content_published_at":1507646067,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Astronomy"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-1a5290ae-9a91-3b2d-a58e-dfc18c68654a_a-48545727-fbc7-3926-852a-501e40702eea","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/book-indian-space-programme-details-60pcchv","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"PR Newswire","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/book-indian-space-programme-details-123000673.html","img":null,"title":"New Book \"The Indian Space Programme\" Details India's Incredible Journey From the Third World Towards the First","summary":"Fifty years in the making, India's Space Programme is fulfilling the vision of its founders and delivering services from space that touch the lives of 1.3 billion people every day.

But new research suggests atomic hydrogen may be equally important to star formation. In the local universe, most hydrogen found inside galaxies exists as individual atoms. Scientists assumed younger galaxies would host less atomic hydrogen and more molecular hydrogen. But cosmic surveys suggest even the earliest galaxies were rich in atomic hydrogen. Now, new analysis by researchers at the University of Western Australia and the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research confirms even galaxies featuring intense rates of star formation host large amounts of atomic hydrogen.","published_at":1507663124,"content_id":"df43d0f2-d2d0-3fee-8b52-48d86d306b73","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/Science_News\/2017\/10\/10\/Study-reveals-importance-of-hydrogen-atoms-for-star-formation\/7311507654175\/","content_published_at":1507662848,"content_relative_time":23,"vibe_name":"Astronomy"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-751a9074-307c-34b9-87e8-e311e3cb574a_a-8214877d-41b7-3f4b-9746-b1723b0985f7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/space-travel-apos-existential-1otdbrt","author":"nanook","provider":"The Atlantic Wire (RSS)","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2017\/10\/how-much-risk-is-space-flight-worth\/541935\/?utm_source=yahoo&yptr=yahoo","img":null,"title":"Space Travel's Existential Question","summary":"The morning of January 27, 1967, Gus Grissom and his Apollo 1 crew put on their flight suits.

Brown was there at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), in Pasadena, California,\u00a0to give us a behind-the-scenes look at\u00a0Cassini's final hours\u2014and delve into the history of the spectacularly successful mission, which provided virtually everything we know about Saturn, its moons, and the potential for life in the planetary system. Hours before Cassini plunged into Saturn on September 15, Dave Doody, a senior engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, sat at the Ace console in mission control and eyed a computer screen lined with codes.","published_at":1507740888,"content_id":"989a7c96-b640-3622-bc05-412d1dbe1d73","content_url":"http:\/\/mentalfloss.com\/article\/504702\/inside-mission-intentionally-destroy-cassini-spacecraft","content_published_at":1507663800,"content_relative_time":23,"vibe_name":"Astronomy"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-bd67f995-d39d-3ccd-aa6d-64fef949f60b_a-c7c9ef17-570b-3492-8c30-ba55a4aae346","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/scientists-discover-one-most-luminous-567o1zb","author":"third_watch","provider":"EurekAlert!","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.eurekalert.org\/pub_releases\/2017-10\/uol-sdo101117.php","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dwELDmXNNF0dszBVmIYrBw--\/dz03MTA7aD0zNDc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_c7c9ef17-570b-3492-8c30-ba55a4aae346-1450711649.jpeg","title":"Scientists discover one of the most luminous 'new stars' ever","summary":"University of Leicester contributes to best-ever results on a 'new star' in a nearby galaxy University of Leicester Astronomers have today announced that they have discovered possibly the most luminous 'new star' ever - a nova discovered in the direction of one of our closest neighboring galaxies: The Small Magellanic Cloud.

Last week, NASA announced that Voyager 1, launched in 1977, crossed into interstellar space. That means it's beyond the reach of the sun and is dependent on its own on-board energy supply.
