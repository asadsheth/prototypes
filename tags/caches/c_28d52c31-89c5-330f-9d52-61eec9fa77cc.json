[{"text":"I'm down with any excuse to \"get my Sagan\" on the guys a legend but...\n\"Without further ado, here are 48 of the best space photos to help you put our Pale Blue Dot in perspective\u2026\"\nI understand you probably can't put the 48 pictures here but how about a link? It's really not difficult to do. This website has long since gone down the toilet, it's now festering in the sewer somewhere...\nTake the comments section, if you've replied to someone else's comment and are awaiting a response to carry on a discussion, you now have to go back to the story and scroll through the comments and find it among hundreds sometimes thousands. Who can be bothered doing that? And so discussion on Yahoo is now dead.","id":"152521bd-894e-4fa0-bed6-fa007255315b","context_id":"7fdb7df6-7fa6-3aec-b27d-bc39b6e0608f","upvotes":23,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Cantarctica","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_C_kl.jpg","score":0.87248169674821,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-228b626c-6551-35b1-a345-fc6e1fe5a84b_a-7fdb7df6-7fa6-3aec-b27d-bc39b6e0608f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/sagan-39-awe-inspiring-photos-3qdzgwm","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Digital Trends","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/sagan-39-awe-inspiring-photos-234513431.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/digital_trends_973\/a24abfe92fba62137f4bdf589fafbc2f","title":"Get your Sagan on with 50 awe-inspiring photos of the final frontier","summary":"Few things instill a sense of wonder quite like the final frontier.

Hopefully humanity can refrain from self-destruction and keep pushing the boundaries of exploration into the unknown.  We humans have so many opportunities to make progress, if we just can avoid destroying our planet and ourselves by our destructive foolish actions.","id":"5e570875-ecb1-40f0-b6c4-ea0455beb693","context_id":"7fdb7df6-7fa6-3aec-b27d-bc39b6e0608f","upvotes":4,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Cantarctica","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_C_kl.jpg","score":0.59864815744379,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-228b626c-6551-35b1-a345-fc6e1fe5a84b_a-7fdb7df6-7fa6-3aec-b27d-bc39b6e0608f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/sagan-39-awe-inspiring-photos-3qdzgwm","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Digital Trends","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/sagan-39-awe-inspiring-photos-234513431.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/digital_trends_973\/a24abfe92fba62137f4bdf589fafbc2f","title":"Get your Sagan on with 50 awe-inspiring photos of the final frontier","summary":"Few things instill a sense of wonder quite like the final frontier.

Many in the region were celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival and attempting to catch a glimpse of the full moon when the meteor stole the show. The space rock entered Earth's atmosphere above China, near the border of Myanmar, bursting into flames with an estimated energy equivalent to 540 tons of TNT. It produced an extremely bright flash which lasted long enough for many witnesses to turn their smartphone cameras skyward and capture the rare sight. Many onlookers posted their own personal videos of the fireball on China's Weibo social network (basically a Chinese Twitter). The videos show a small bright light eventually growing into a large flash before fizzling out, temporarily providing enough light to mimic daytime. https:\/\/twitter.com\/Yeqzids\/status\/915704155439644672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Fnews%2Fchina%2Fsociety%2Farticle%2F2114147%2Ffireball-brings-mid-autumn-surprise-chinese-skywatchers-seeking While it might look like the beginning of the apocalypse, the impressive fireball hasn't been linked to any damage or casualties. That said, local news reports have noted that it caused buildings to shake as it detonated in sky. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pQquVZk5KKM According to NASA's tracking of such fireballs \u2014 yes, NASA documents every single one \u2014 the most recent fireball of similar size in China fell in 2014, so they're not unheard of, but they sure are neat to look at.\u00a0 This most recent one is thought to have exploded over mountainous terrain, which would make finding any resulting meteorites extremely difficult. For a shooting star to make it on NASA's fireball list it has to meet some minimum criteria. \"A\u00a0fireball\u00a0is an unusually bright meteor that reaches a visual magnitude of -3 or brighter when seen at the observer\u2019s zenith,\" the agency explains. \"Objects causing fireball events can exceed one meter in size.

The heart and mind are the true lens of the camera.\u201d -Yousuf Karsh For hundreds of years, the principle behind the telescope has been as simple as it gets: build a lens or mirror to collect a large amount of light, focus that light onto a detector (like an eye, a photographic plate, or an electronic device), and see far beyond the capabilities of your unaided vision. Over time, lenses and mirrors have gotten bigger in diameter and have been crafted to higher precision, while detectors have advanced to the point where they can collect and make good use of every single incoming photon.

As a result, the moon does not seem to be spinning but appears to observers from Earth to be keeping almost perfectly still. Scientists call this synchronous rotation.

Using data collected by NASA's Messenger mission between 2010 and 2015, scientists plotted a color-coded map of the Victoria Quadrangle, a crater-filled region in Mercury's northern hemisphere. Researchers used colors to distinguish different types of craters and geological features. Crater characteristics -- like levels of degradation -- helped scientists estimate the density and age of the surrounding surface. categorize The entirety of the Victoria Quadrangle features 1,789 craters","published_at":1507561423,"content_id":"19b0c4ef-2e51-391f-a8d1-eb87f70387df","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Science_News\/2017\/10\/09\/Mercury-map-renders-the-innermost-planets-geology-in-color\/3441507551804\/","content_published_at":1507559294,"content_relative_time":7,"vibe_name":"Astronomy"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-34b61e18-0437-3f9c-9b1c-398088555a1f_a-1d41ef7c-e80a-3dce-8838-ec5f260fa07a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/richard-branson-says-birgin-galactic-3262vam","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Mail Online","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencetech\/article-4963304\/Richard-Branson-says-SIX-MONTHS-going-space.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailUK","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rwU0HrErtsDZKSsMbgDw9A--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1d41ef7c-e80a-3dce-8838-ec5f260fa07a-50321117.jpeg","title":"Richard Branson says Birgin Galactic is SIX MONTHS from going to space","summary":"Richard Branson has claimed he will go on a trip to space with his company Virgin Galactic within the next six months.

For as long as astronomers have known about them, they have sought to understand how SMBHs form and evolve.

To be specific, an increasing number of galaxies are no longer able to form new stars. Just 10 billion years ago, the universe was burgeoning with plentiful star formation. So why is the health of galaxies on the decline? New research on a massive galaxy approximately 310 million light-years away is shedding new light on one culprit responsible for killing galaxies. The results find a process, known as ram-pressure stripping, is more effective at dispatching galaxies than once thought.
