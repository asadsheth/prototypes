Many in the region were celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival and attempting to catch a glimpse of the full moon when the meteor stole the show. The space rock entered Earth's atmosphere above China, near the border of Myanmar, bursting into flames with an estimated energy equivalent to 540 tons of TNT. It produced an extremely bright flash which lasted long enough for many witnesses to turn their smartphone cameras skyward and capture the rare sight. Many onlookers posted their own personal videos of the fireball on China's Weibo social network (basically a Chinese Twitter). The videos show a small bright light eventually growing into a large flash before fizzling out, temporarily providing enough light to mimic daytime. https:\/\/twitter.com\/Yeqzids\/status\/915704155439644672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Fnews%2Fchina%2Fsociety%2Farticle%2F2114147%2Ffireball-brings-mid-autumn-surprise-chinese-skywatchers-seeking While it might look like the beginning of the apocalypse, the impressive fireball hasn't been linked to any damage or casualties. That said, local news reports have noted that it caused buildings to shake as it detonated in sky. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pQquVZk5KKM According to NASA's tracking of such fireballs \u2014 yes, NASA documents every single one \u2014 the most recent fireball of similar size in China fell in 2014, so they're not unheard of, but they sure are neat to look at.\u00a0 This most recent one is thought to have exploded over mountainous terrain, which would make finding any resulting meteorites extremely difficult. For a shooting star to make it on NASA's fireball list it has to meet some minimum criteria. \"A\u00a0fireball\u00a0is an unusually bright meteor that reaches a visual magnitude of -3 or brighter when seen at the observer\u2019s zenith,\" the agency explains. \"Objects causing fireball events can exceed one meter in size. Fireballs that explode in the atmosphere are technically referred to as\u00a0bolides\u00a0although the terms fireballs and bolides are often used interchangeably.\"","published_at":1507341914,"content_id":"49c88dca-7dda-3e4f-ad5f-69df17d17f50","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/watch-flaming-meteor-streak-across-night-sky-china-020314198.html","content_published_at":1507341794,"content_relative_time":64,"vibe_name":"Astronomy"},"created_at":1507352731,"comment_relative_time":61,"bot":false},{"text":"That's a magnificent view of Jupiter!","id":"c6b7e377-981e-4249-b5b7-4dd984b4d1ed","context_id":"7fdb7df6-7fa6-3aec-b27d-bc39b6e0608f","upvotes":6,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"ghostrider49th","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_G_jl.jpg","score":0.63286794713747,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-228b626c-6551-35b1-a345-fc6e1fe5a84b_a-7fdb7df6-7fa6-3aec-b27d-bc39b6e0608f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/sagan-39-awe-inspiring-photos-3qdzgwm","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Digital Trends","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/sagan-39-awe-inspiring-photos-234513431.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/digital_trends_973\/a24abfe92fba62137f4bdf589fafbc2f","title":"Get your Sagan on with 50 awe-inspiring photos of the final frontier","summary":"Few things instill a sense of wonder quite like the final frontier.

Many in the region were celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival and attempting to catch a glimpse of the full moon when the meteor stole the show. The space rock entered Earth's atmosphere above China, near the border of Myanmar, bursting into flames with an estimated energy equivalent to 540 tons of TNT. It produced an extremely bright flash which lasted long enough for many witnesses to turn their smartphone cameras skyward and capture the rare sight. Many onlookers posted their own personal videos of the fireball on China's Weibo social network (basically a Chinese Twitter). The videos show a small bright light eventually growing into a large flash before fizzling out, temporarily providing enough light to mimic daytime. https:\/\/twitter.com\/Yeqzids\/status\/915704155439644672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Fnews%2Fchina%2Fsociety%2Farticle%2F2114147%2Ffireball-brings-mid-autumn-surprise-chinese-skywatchers-seeking While it might look like the beginning of the apocalypse, the impressive fireball hasn't been linked to any damage or casualties.

For a shooting star to make it on NASA's fireball list it has to meet some minimum criteria. \"A\u00a0fireball\u00a0is an unusually bright meteor that reaches a visual magnitude of -3 or brighter when seen at the observer\u2019s zenith,\" the agency explains. \"Objects causing fireball events can exceed one meter in size.

This may lead to the question, does the moon rotate? The answer is yes, though it may seem contrary to what our eyes observe. The 'dark' side of the moon The moon orbits the Earth once every 27.322 days. It also takes approximately 27 days for the moon to rotate once on its axis.

Crater characteristics -- like levels of degradation -- helped scientists estimate the density and age of the surrounding surface. categorize The entirety of the Victoria Quadrangle features 1,789 craters","published_at":1507561423,"content_id":"19b0c4ef-2e51-391f-a8d1-eb87f70387df","content_url":"https:\/\/www.upi.com\/https:\/www.upi.com\/Science_News\/2017\/10\/09\/Mercury-map-renders-the-innermost-planets-geology-in-color\/3441507551804\/","content_published_at":1507559294,"content_relative_time":4,"vibe_name":"Astronomy"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":4,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-34b61e18-0437-3f9c-9b1c-398088555a1f_a-1d41ef7c-e80a-3dce-8838-ec5f260fa07a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/richard-branson-says-birgin-galactic-3262vam","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Mail Online","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencetech\/article-4963304\/Richard-Branson-says-SIX-MONTHS-going-space.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailUK","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rwU0HrErtsDZKSsMbgDw9A--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_1d41ef7c-e80a-3dce-8838-ec5f260fa07a-50321117.jpeg","title":"Richard Branson says Birgin Galactic is SIX MONTHS from going to space","summary":"Richard Branson has claimed he will go on a trip to space with his company Virgin Galactic within the next six months.

Agreed on during a golden age of cooperation between the then-dominant superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States, the treaty deems space a domain to be shared by all nations. It states: \u201cThe exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind.\u201d The treaty gave rise to a series of others that govern space today: the Rescue Agreement (1968), the Liability Convention (1972), the Registration Convention (1976) and the","published_at":1507567263,"content_id":"7debb440-bb8c-317e-a458-013ac0845b99","content_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/news\/build-on-the-outer-space-treaty-1.22789?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NatureNewsComment+%28Nature+News+%26+Comment%29","content_published_at":1507532400,"content_relative_time":11,"vibe_name":"Astronomy"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":11,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-db549af2-18e8-3dfc-9d3d-22f9ccd585e7_a-27a73ce7-cd33-300c-a677-f0a88def2acc","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/scientist-treasure-trove-giant-black-4g2lkmh","author":"third_watch","provider":"Universe Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.universetoday.com\/137421\/scientist-find-treasure-trove-giant-black-hole-pairs\/","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/E9BJNtT3S2SvwuBjVLAtaw--\/dz0yMDAwO2g9MTUwOTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_27a73ce7-cd33-300c-a677-f0a88def2acc-740693500.jpeg","title":"Scientist Find Treasure Trove of Giant Black Hole Pairs","summary":"For decades, astronomers have known that Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) reside at the center of most massive galaxies. These black holes, which range from being hundreds of thousands to billions of Solar masses, exert a powerful influence on surrounding matter and are believed to be the cause of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). For as long as astronomers have known about them, they have sought to understand how SMBHs form and evolve. In two recently published studies, two international teams of researchers report on the discovery of five newly-discovered black hole pairs at the centers of distant galaxies.
