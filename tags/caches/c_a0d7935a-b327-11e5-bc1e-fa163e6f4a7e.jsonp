Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray have reached a deal \"in principle\" to restore Affordable Care Act cost-sharing reduction payments for two years in exchange for more state flexibility in Obamacare.

An Alexander aide told CNN that Republicans would get a provision they wanted, a major change in how states measure the affordability of insurance under their waiver requests. This would allow states a lot more flexibility, but that final language was still being ironed out.
