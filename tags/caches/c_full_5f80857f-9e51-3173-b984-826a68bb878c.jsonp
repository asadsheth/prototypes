There was belief in the air, belief in a brisk practice on the ice and in the Vegas dressing room, words of hope. What else do they have left? What else could they say or sell with the series tilting so far against them? There is a time in almost every championship series that takes on a sense of finality before it ever ends.","published_at":1528329766,"content_id":"933c0f56-759c-361b-ba6f-1ab671cddb07","content_url":"http:\/\/torontosun.com\/sports\/hockey\/nhl\/simmons-is-this-the-end-for-the-golden-knights?src=rss","content_published_at":1528310030,"content_time":1528310030,"content_relative_time":21,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"NHL","vibe_id":"5f80857f-9e51-3173-b984-826a68bb878c","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":21,"comment_relative_time":21,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6bca0585-91f7-3aeb-b938-361964ede350","post_id":"v-5f80857f-9e51-3173-b984-826a68bb878c_c-8c2e1e33-f98b-32e8-b075-682e026972e3_a-6bca0585-91f7-3aeb-b938-361964ede350","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f80857f-9e51-3173-b984-826a68bb878c_c-8c2e1e33-f98b-32e8-b075-682e026972e3_a-6bca0585-91f7-3aeb-b938-361964ede350","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nhl\/capitals-chandler-stephenson-parlayed-versatility-51g7g5m","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Washington Post","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/capitals-insider\/wp\/2018\/06\/06\/capitals-chandler-stephenson-has-parlayed-his-versatility-into-a-bright-nhl-future\/","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/yb0CnafMk4ebG.EtPh3dZg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eiwKQFJnmNMw_gVS9gKP8Q--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9OTg4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6bca0585-91f7-3aeb-b938-361964ede350-1853306572.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3amBA_E9HzWT0voPjLN1vg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD05ODg7dz0xNDg0Ow--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eiwKQFJnmNMw_gVS9gKP8Q--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9OTg4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6bca0585-91f7-3aeb-b938-361964ede350-1853306572.jpeg","height":988,"width":1484,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/eiwKQFJnmNMw_gVS9gKP8Q--\/dz0xNDg0O2g9OTg4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6bca0585-91f7-3aeb-b938-361964ede350-1853306572.jpeg","imgw":1484,"imgh":988,"title":"Capitals' Chandler Stephenson has parlayed his versatility into a bright NHL future","summary":"LAS VEGAS \u2014 Just a year ago, Chandler Stephenson was toiling in the Washington Capitals' minor league system, working on his game during the American Hockey League playoffs with the Hershey Bears.

Here's how smouldering embers ignite into trade speculation and how the Vancouver Canucks get linked to yet another rumour because they need to replace the retired Henrik Sedin. It's been nearly a month since Ryan O'Reilly let loose on locker cleanout day. The Buffalo Sabres' centre said he had become OK with losing and had lost his love of the game. An honest assessment of another bad campaign became good trade-fodder material. O'Reilly led Sabre forwards in ice time, had a decent 61 points (24-37), but was minus-23 on the NHL's last-place team that iced the worst offence and third-worst defence.
