It comes down to a lack of (the true) God in people\u2019s lives.  Think back to the shooting that took place in Las Vegas in October 2017; this was a country music concert where 58 people died and 546 were injured.  Many see a concert like this filled with Christian, conservatives who supported Trump (which is not 100% correct).  After the shooting, many people posted messages that they were happy with the shooting and wished more Trump were killed.  Can you imagine that in the USA, people are wishing the deaths of others because of their political views?  It is pretty ironic when Democrats, who for the most part want guns removed, are wishing the deaths of others.  \n\nOf course many will continue to blame guns as the problem thinking that removing the guns will stop this violence, but which is worse, the person who devises a plan to kill or the weapon that was used?  If there were no guns available, an determined person would still be bent on killing.  Just like Cain killed Able, Cain did not need a gun to kill his brother, only intent.  Think of the many ways a person could kill large groups of people; a person could: douse the church with gasoline, drive a truck through the entrance while people are exiting, use machetes to hack people, detonate a homemade bomb, released poison gas into the building, etc.  All of these methods have already been used here and around the world where it is hard to get guns.  If we take away the guns, we will also have to stop selling cars, gasoline, knives, etc.  Determined people will continue to kill whether there are guns or not.  \n\nThe real reason why we are seeing so much violence here in America is because we have allowed God to be removed from our schools, our government and from our public places.  We are upset at these murders, yet we are not upset that the Giver of true and good laws has been removed from our community.  Think about it\u2026  The 10 Commandments tells us \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d, yet we are the ones who allowed the 10 Commandments to be removed from any governmental place.   We have done this to ourselves by moving \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d is out of sight and out of mind.  \n\nThose who are devoid of God are now starting to attack those who do know God.  According to the Bible, in the end-days we will see the world turn against God and viscously attack Christians:\n\nRevelation 6:9 - When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony which they had maintained \n\nRevelation 20:4 - \u2026And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God\n\nAs you see, believers of God will be killed for their belief in Him.  Is this now the beginning of the end-days persecution of Christians?  When people are wishing and acting on the deaths of others, obviously we are at the threshold.  Are you ready for what is about to come?","message_id":"ee7eb23e-8fda-414d-81bd-53a60b2007e1","context_id":"be0bc8cb-02ee-329d-bfee-5d9bc3416867","upvotes":36,"downvotes":7,"reports":0,"replies":9,"author_name":"Brett","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_jl.jpg","author_guid":"WTBUIEGAQLIGTTIVQXWPDBAAJM","score":0.82092292731344,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-427bf91e-53b2-360a-8760-f0fc0c728c2b_a-be0bc8cb-02ee-329d-bfee-5d9bc3416867","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-427bf91e-53b2-360a-8760-f0fc0c728c2b_a-be0bc8cb-02ee-329d-bfee-5d9bc3416867","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/texas-massacre-seized-both-sides-gun-debate-192120606.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/ap_webfeeds\/f28ae927852048b980662f33fd8ac2e5.jpg","title":"Texas massacre is seized on by both sides in gun debate","summary":"Gun-rights supporters have seized on the Texas church massacre as proof of the well-worn saying that the best answer to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
