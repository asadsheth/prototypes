Not manufacturing runs by playing 'small ball', etc. He is calling out millennial weenies for swinging for the fences, expecting immediate gratification, etc.\nAnd by the way , a strikeout is different from a 'regular ' out in many cases. What is a 'regular' out, anyway - just not a strikeout? So, if you strike out with no outs and a man on third, it is no different than a long fly out? Or a sac bunt to move a man along.","message_id":"f5a70905-0197-48b5-a504-e78090589ddc","context_id":"e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","upvotes":6,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"learyj","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_L_jd_3_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"5VTPIXWNKKIOXXGA4M3X6KZN2E","score":0.71911575945596,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-e5c84c07-8f22-3ab7-af63-321f06ea9ef7_a-e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-45aqrjq","author":"nanook","provider":"Big League Stew","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-074225129.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/f4ab9bfea644312d84345795fb1f768d","title":"Steve Garvey blames Dodgers loss in Game 2 on 'Millennial baseball'","summary":"Those dang Millennials are ruining baseball now according to Dodgers legend Steve Garvey.","published_at":1508998086,"content_id":"e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-074225129.html","content_published_at":1509003745,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1509033079,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"My daughter plays highly competitive fastpitch softball.

Gonna be tough in Houston g=to get two wins.","message_id":"c8cc4346-e0b7-49c7-b298-fe8c350d4c93","context_id":"e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","upvotes":20,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"William","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_W_kl.jpg","author_guid":"V3J2TOBZEWKMUGQOQV3NTSSXJE","score":0.88252744480854,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-e5c84c07-8f22-3ab7-af63-321f06ea9ef7_a-e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-45aqrjq","author":"nanook","provider":"Big League Stew","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-074225129.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/f4ab9bfea644312d84345795fb1f768d","title":"Steve Garvey blames Dodgers loss in Game 2 on 'Millennial baseball'","summary":"Those dang Millennials are ruining baseball now according to Dodgers legend Steve Garvey.","published_at":1508998086,"content_id":"e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-074225129.html","content_published_at":1509003745,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1509025228,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"It's the saber metrics nonsense that has ruined the sport.

I'm a genXer, and I remember the Boomer's and Great generation being critical on our baseball dress code (backwards hat in warm ups like Griffey Jr.,  low brim over eyebrows like Dave Stewart, Oakley Blades like Rickey, and even eliminating stir-ups).  I'm now the old guy that cant stand flat brims or crooked hats.  However, Garvey is not wrong in his assessment.  Sure Home Runs are an important part of the game.  Dave Kingman, Dale Murphy, Mark McGuire, and Jose Canseo are all examples of players in the 80's that were known for risk reward fence swinging.  However, taking a few strikes when you are down by two runs is baseball common sense.  Putting the ball in play is indeed better than a strikeout. Always allow your opponent to make the mental or physical error rather than you.  Now, if you have a hitter count go ahead and dig in and hack away.  Otherwise, Garvey is accurate when it comes to playoff baseball.  A perfect example is game 7 of the 2001 world series when the best closer in baseball history (Rivera) blew a save to the base to base Diamondbacks to lose the World series.

The real racist are the SOB's that disrespect our flag.","message_id":"83da3e19-1245-4831-b119-12066026656c","context_id":"0fa8ab0d-7261-3cf3-a42d-5a92ee45fe1f","upvotes":59,"downvotes":6,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"pappajoe","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/64faf6c22c25057da73cc51bd609f7ed_192.jpeg","author_guid":"554OUUWKFKQP3YLG4SQILMVJBI","score":0.89065803458889,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-9707caa7-a05f-3e53-9ba7-0a5106709d53_a-0fa8ab0d-7261-3cf3-a42d-5a92ee45fe1f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/trump-supporter-recognizes-maxwell-denies-1a92n51","author":"third_watch","provider":"NBC Sports BayArea","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/trump-supporter-recognizes-maxwell-denies-011435354.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/csnbayarea.com\/2c5b24249602b337bb82ebc11cf93b52","title":"Trump supporter recognizes Maxwell, denies him service in hometown restaurant","summary":"In a recent interview, the Oakland A's catcher told the story of what happened to him four hours after he arrived to his hometown...","published_at":1508969034,"content_id":"0fa8ab0d-7261-3cf3-a42d-5a92ee45fe1f","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/trump-supporter-recognizes-maxwell-denies-011435354.html","content_published_at":1508894075,"content_relative_time":39,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1508941126,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":false},{"text":"Everyone knows the FBI removed the hard drive.","message_id":"fe3668b8-c4ea-4c0c-898b-57773d538cb4","context_id":"1d9bc14a-0a09-3e8f-9315-b46ce61548a7","upvotes":78,"downvotes":9,"reports":0,"replies":5,"author_name":"booksoup101","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_jl_2.jpg","author_guid":"DBLRPLYOMMR54JCQOSXV4B66XI","score":0.88968414410424,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-170dae25-334c-3088-a647-712a8c32a690_a-1d9bc14a-0a09-3e8f-9315-b46ce61548a7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/las-vegas-shooters-laptop-missing-hard-drive-164602407--abc-news-topstories-3w54die","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Good Morning America","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/las-vegas-shooters-laptop-missing-hard-drive-164602407--abc-news-topstories.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.abcnewsplus.com\/0eb74824d93bd03fc1aab5dee84fe0e0","title":"Las Vegas shooter's laptop missing its hard drive","summary":"A laptop computer recovered from the Las Vegas hotel room where Stephen Paddock launched the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history was missing its hard drive, depriving investigators of a potential key source of information on why he killed and maimed so many people, ABC News has learned.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508913671,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1508950947,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":false},{"text":"Bat-crap crazy . . .

The strict following of Wahhabism version of Islam by the Saudi government has created lot of problems for the whole world.  Better late than never.  Turning towards moderate ideas of Islam will make many terrorist activities disappear which means peace and tranquility in the world, and also it will save lots of innocent lives.  This decision by the Saudi government needs to be applauded by all civilized nations.  The money spent on madrasses to train martyrs will be invested for the welfare of people.  This writer just wonders if other Muslim countries supporting jihadi ideology will take a cue from the Saudis and stop assisting fundamentalists and divert their financial resources towards meaningful channels.  I think it will be a good idea if the Saudi government publishes details of its new policy explaining modern Islam - for example, their policy towards stopping Jihadi ideology through mosques and madrasses, equal rights for all genders, freedom of speech and fundamental rights, equal rights for all people practicing different religions etc.","message_id":"b175fa47-ef5b-443a-b2b7-68302ab02054","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":152,"downvotes":13,"reports":0,"replies":31,"author_name":"Dharam","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ald.jpg","author_guid":"FKP6XRHAQXBOIXHF4FJMTMND6Y","score":0.92067951140755,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-84f197e9-c436-3df6-81fb-b0f6f29167bb_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-84f197e9-c436-3df6-81fb-b0f6f29167bb_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","author":"nanook","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/d631b74dcaf6578e0ef456e029892e0e","title":"Saudi Arabia's crown prince promises to lead his country 'back to moderate Islam'","summary":"Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious young crown prince has said he will lead his country back to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d as he announced plans for a vast new \u00a3380 million economic development zone.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed bin Salman told investors gathered in Riyadh that his economic modernisation plans would go hand-in-hand with with political reforms to guide the conservative kingdom away from severe Wahhabi Islam.\u00a0 \"We are returning to what we were before - a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,\" the 32-year-old prince said. \"We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas.

Kuwait isn't Saudi, but the two countries have enough in common that i can assess the plans that the prince is making.  I rate his chance of success as low.  He is squeezed by too many constraints.  He has to get major change before the oil revenue dries up (the world is already starting to turn its back on fossil fuels), which means he needs major change within 30 years or less.  The country has no significant natural resources other than oil, so its only hope will be the hard work and ingenuity of its people.  (Like Singapore, for example.)  But Saudis are not accustomed to hard work, and their education system does not turn out people who are creative and dynamic.  Also, the culture does not encourage innovation.  The religion encourages fatalism and passivity, not a \"can-do\" attitude.  Bringing massive and fundamental change to a culture and to its educational systems is certainly possible - but I don't think it is possible in a mere 30 years.  I think Saudi probably faces a very grim future.","message_id":"9f771861-0ed5-4c1c-b89b-172063ca3b20","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":29,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":6,"author_name":"Linda Sutherland","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_L_ad.jpg","author_guid":"XBBOAJV4H2TOADM3S36525BTUM","score":0.8759610135884,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-84f197e9-c436-3df6-81fb-b0f6f29167bb_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-84f197e9-c436-3df6-81fb-b0f6f29167bb_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","author":"nanook","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/d631b74dcaf6578e0ef456e029892e0e","title":"Saudi Arabia's crown prince promises to lead his country 'back to moderate Islam'","summary":"Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious young crown prince has said he will lead his country back to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d as he announced plans for a vast new \u00a3380 million economic development zone.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed bin Salman told investors gathered in Riyadh that his economic modernisation plans would go hand-in-hand with with political reforms to guide the conservative kingdom away from severe Wahhabi Islam.\u00a0 \"We are returning to what we were before - a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,\" the 32-year-old prince said. \"We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508913671,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1508893024,"comment_relative_time":39,"bot":false},{"text":"There are Americans in the USA and there are Trump Supporters in the USA.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508913671,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1508872630,"comment_relative_time":45,"bot":false},{"text":"Republicans are not evil people.

While the uproar is sustained by the removal of Confederate monuments, that struggle is merely a facade covering the much more complicated reality. A fresh battle for the racial soul of the U.S. is afoot, and it\u2019s being waged among white Americans.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a race war as it\u2019s typically understood: African Americans and other marginalized peoples taking their fight for civil rights and dignity to the streets against an oppressive and dominating white male-led establishment.\n\nTo be sure, elements of this historic struggle are present and ongoing as part of our nation\u2019s evolution toward a more perfect union, but the current and immediate battle is unique because it\u2019s being waged almost exclusively among white Americans. This was exhibited violently in the streets of Charlottesville, where a clear majority of the participants on both sides \u2014 KKK and Nazis versus anti-racism activists \u2014 were white people. All of the dead, including 32-year-old Heather Heyer and the two Virginia State Police pilots, Trooper Berke M.M. Bates, 40, and Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, were white Americans. Literally, this was a white-on-white riot.\n\nWhat took place in Charlottesville and the resulting political fallout represents an internecine struggle over the quantity and quality of racism that white Americans want to embrace or tolerate as the nation grows increasingly multicultural. While they are ardent and aggressive activists in the fight against white supremacists and deserve to be heard, members of marginalized communities \u2014 African Americans, Latinos, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and women of all colors \u2014 are not the primary actors in this unfolding drama. Rather, it is incumbent upon white Americans to accept and deal with the fact that soon the nation will no longer have a white majority population.\nRead more at: https:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/after-charlottesville-the-real-struggle-f04f8540c6e7\/","message_id":"485f0434-1ffb-44c8-a11a-ab8fdc1439e2","context_id":"e9655a94-3a53-30fc-9715-59014b085e98","upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Micheal","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_M_jd_1_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"XJOETZ5ISQ6Z56757GBYN5NL2I","score":0.64841045908534,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-6ad60d14-3397-3ac2-9279-1971c5768ccf_a-e9655a94-3a53-30fc-9715-59014b085e98","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-6ad60d14-3397-3ac2-9279-1971c5768ccf_a-e9655a94-3a53-30fc-9715-59014b085e98","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"The Wrap","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/sen-jeff-flake-blasts-trump-abandons-2018-bid-203225244.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/TheWrap\/Sen_Jeff_Flake_Blasts_Trump-04fc5577369f4908861f0b242ce8edd7","title":"Sen.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508913671,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1508888687,"comment_relative_time":40,"bot":false},{"text":"Filthy 45 doesn't pay his bills--he rips hard-working people off, he makes fun of people, he lies, he's a racist, he's a sexist, he's illiterate, he's stupid.","message_id":"154c054d-8f05-4552-9d5c-9fd62b2c308e","context_id":"e9655a94-3a53-30fc-9715-59014b085e98","upvotes":36,"downvotes":23,"reports":0,"replies":4,"author_name":"Hands Down","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_H_ad.jpg","author_guid":"A23M5QNILT7CJUVCS4BXUPADYA","score":0.63942012662999,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-6ad60d14-3397-3ac2-9279-1971c5768ccf_a-e9655a94-3a53-30fc-9715-59014b085e98","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-6ad60d14-3397-3ac2-9279-1971c5768ccf_a-e9655a94-3a53-30fc-9715-59014b085e98","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"The Wrap","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/sen-jeff-flake-blasts-trump-abandons-2018-bid-203225244.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/TheWrap\/Sen_Jeff_Flake_Blasts_Trump-04fc5577369f4908861f0b242ce8edd7","title":"Sen.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508913671,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Entertainment","vibe_id":"7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a"},"created_at":1508869755,"comment_relative_time":46,"bot":false},{"text":"Both senators should resign now.
