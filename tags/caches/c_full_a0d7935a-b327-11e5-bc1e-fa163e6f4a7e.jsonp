Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray have reached a deal \"in principle\" to restore Affordable Care Act cost-sharing reduction payments for two years in exchange for more state flexibility in Obamacare. One Senate aide said the plan would also restore just over $100 million in funding for Obamacare outreach. An Alexander aide told CNN that Republicans would get a provision they wanted, a major change in how states measure the affordability of insurance under their waiver requests. This would allow states a lot more flexibility, but that final language was still being ironed out. The deal would make it easier for states to obtain waivers to customize Obamacare rules to their needs.

Obamacare violates the 10th Amendment, States Rights Amendment of the Constitution by preventing citizens from voting on it.  Obamacare violates the 4th Amendment, the right to privacy Amendment.  Obamacare violates HIPPA privacy law issued by the Department of Health and Human Service entitled the \u201cHealth Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  More American scientists have won Nobel Prizes in Medicine than the other 226 countries combined.  Obamacare as defined by the Supreme Court is a tax.  Repeal it!  Obamacare is not about health nor is it about insurance.  Its primary purpose is to move $5.1 trillion in Gross Domestic Product produced by the health care and insurance industry from the private sector into the public sector, namely into the U.S. Treasury to be spent as Congress and the President see fit.  Its secondary purpose is to reduce government costs by depriving the poor of adequate health care to save government $533 billion dollars in Medicaid annually and to deprive the sick adequate health care to save government $588 billion in Medicare annually.  The caveat is that if they catch the elderly soon enough government can also save $924 million dollars in Social Security annually.  Under Obama we saw how government run health care worked at the Veterans Administration in Phoenix in 2015.  The VA killed 40 of America\u2019s finest by depriving them of basic health care, just to save money.  If government would kill America\u2019s finest they would not think twice about you or me.

The subsidies, called cost-sharing reductions\u00a0\u2014 or CSRs\u00a0\u2014 are federal payments to insurers that are used to offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket health costs for lower-income Americans. The White House announced it was ending the subsidy payments late last week, injecting new uncertainty into insurance marketplaces. President Trump expressed support for Tuesday's bipartisan deal.
