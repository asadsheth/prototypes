The chairmen of House and Senate committees with partial jurisdiction over health-care policy big-footed their way into the conversation with a competing proposal that sure sounds like what Trump has been promoting. Senate Finance Committee chairman Orrin Hatch and House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady paused from their tax-cut labors long to enough to unveil a significantly more conservative \u201cstabilization\u201d proposal than that of their bipartisan Senate colleagues, and almost certainly one that a critical mass of Democrats will reject. In exchange for a two-year extension of CSR reimbursements to insurers to head off premium spikes and abandonment of insurance exchanges, Hatch and Brady would suspend enforcement of Obamacare's individual and employer mandates even longer, while expanding the GOP's pet health-care panacea of health savings accounts to help people pay out-of-pocket for their own care.","published_at":1508987042,"content_id":"e259e254-d3b0-3fa3-8361-48b515e0227f","content_url":"http:\/\/nymag.com\/daily\/intelligencer\/2017\/10\/gop-obamacare-fix-alternative-is-really-just-a-poison-pill.html","content_published_at":1508870218,"content_relative_time":45,"vibe_name":"Health Care Reform","vibe_id":"a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":45,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-a0d7935a-b327-11e5-bc1e-fa163e6f4a7e_c-a758935f-39a9-32a7-924b-aa3cde66cd8e_a-4dd18a22-3a02-3817-b823-9837d0b56329","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/obamacare\/bipartisan-health-care-bill-save-1wh1xe4","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"ABC News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Health\/wireStory\/latest-bipartisan-health-care-bill-save-money-50709121?yptr=yahoo","img":null,"title":"Bipartisan health care bill would save money","summary":"The Latest on the upcoming start of the 2018 sign-up season for the Affordable Care Act (all times local): 11:35 a.m. Congressional budget analysts say a bipartisan health care bill would save the government money and it isn't likely to have much impact \u2014 either way \u2014 on the number of people with coverage.
