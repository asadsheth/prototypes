Following the unfortunate, filmed and wrongful arrest of two black patrons, Rashon\u00a0 Nelson and Donte Robinson, in an all-too-familiar scene at a Starbucks store in Philadelphia, the company has perhaps disproportionately decided to shut 8,000 of its U.S. establishments on May 29 for\u00a0racial bias training.","published_at":1524469792,"content_id":"dc35db06-93b6-3379-87b9-c3a5117fb4b2","content_url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/dantedisparte\/2018\/04\/22\/starbucks-i-take-my-coffee-black\/","content_published_at":1524459600,"content_time":1524459600,"content_relative_time":18,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Starbucks","vibe_id":"94164ff6-8e84-35cd-a080-04e6fd60deef","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":18,"comment_relative_time":18,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed","post_id":"v-94164ff6-8e84-35cd-a080-04e6fd60deef_c-8d523f6e-52d3-340c-b648-32bd8a65fa57_a-6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-94164ff6-8e84-35cd-a080-04e6fd60deef_c-8d523f6e-52d3-340c-b648-32bd8a65fa57_a-6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/starbucks-1490333697\/monday-memo-earnings-alaska-air-4it4ecs","author":"nanook","provider":"The Seattle Times","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/business\/monday-memo-earnings-from-alaska-air-boeing-amazon-starbucks-and-microsoft-plus-seattle-area-home-prices-and-2-ipos\/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/sEGUUrwprgFTU5oaBoVkiQ--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/w6rZtpXsFQKiKeGnBUFqow--\/dz03ODA7aD01MDE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed--1426429366.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/mG42jTLXuXGCxX2nspMz4Q--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01MDE7dz03ODA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/w6rZtpXsFQKiKeGnBUFqow--\/dz03ODA7aD01MDE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed--1426429366.jpeg","height":501,"width":780,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/w6rZtpXsFQKiKeGnBUFqow--\/dz03ODA7aD01MDE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6e5d1425-6bbb-3c54-8818-2e82ca5124ed--1426429366.jpeg","imgw":780,"imgh":501,"title":"Monday Memo: Earnings from Alaska Air, Boeing, Amazon, Starbucks and Microsoft, plus Seattle-area home prices and 2 IPOs","summary":"SOMETIME THIS WEEK: Two Washington companies are expected to go public this week: Bellevue-based Smartsheet, which makes project tracking and workflow software, and Vancouver-based nLight, a maker of semiconductor and fiber lasers for industrial companies.

Mr. Nelson asked the white female manager to use the restroom and was told by her that they were reserved for paying customers. The incident (which lasted only a few minutes) was recorded on a cell phone and received millions of views, sparking (yet one more) debate about race in America. The incident has had significant consequences for the manager (who appears to have been fired), the police (the commissioner has deeply apologized) and the company (Starbucks was widely criticized, and its founder, known for his political liberalism, has scheduled a day when thousands of stores will be closed--at incalculable expense--for racial sensitivity training for all workers).","published_at":1524417792,"content_id":"8d9eab89-3209-3fbf-aa0a-c380a6185af6","content_url":"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/incompetence\/201804\/foolishness-in-starbucks","content_published_at":1524380400,"content_time":1524380400,"content_relative_time":40,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Starbucks","vibe_id":"94164ff6-8e84-35cd-a080-04e6fd60deef","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":40,"comment_relative_time":40,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"16287304-a3d6-369f-873c-bca4772b8acc","post_id":"v-94164ff6-8e84-35cd-a080-04e6fd60deef_c-3a6ca591-7f58-3610-b829-180d9ce73ee8_a-16287304-a3d6-369f-873c-bca4772b8acc","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-94164ff6-8e84-35cd-a080-04e6fd60deef_c-3a6ca591-7f58-3610-b829-180d9ce73ee8_a-16287304-a3d6-369f-873c-bca4772b8acc","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/starbucks-1490333697\/v-94164ff6-8e84-35cd-a080-04e6fd60deef_c-3a6ca591-7f58-3610-b829-180d9ce73ee8_a-16287304-a3d6-369f-873c-bca4772b8acc","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"ABC News","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/News\/starbucks-mass-training-controversial-arrests-focus-implicit-bias\/story?id=54638486","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/DKoKYro3jjzZZtuvhyM7mw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/I7R1QffjrKVfEaZWhCm.IQ--\/dz05OTI7aD01NTg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_16287304-a3d6-369f-873c-bca4772b8acc--2042492028.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/CPgdrd8bKoykOlU0mw_HMg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD01NTg7dz05OTI7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/I7R1QffjrKVfEaZWhCm.IQ--\/dz05OTI7aD01NTg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_16287304-a3d6-369f-873c-bca4772b8acc--2042492028.jpeg","height":558,"width":992,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/I7R1QffjrKVfEaZWhCm.IQ--\/dz05OTI7aD01NTg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_16287304-a3d6-369f-873c-bca4772b8acc--2042492028.jpeg","imgw":992,"imgh":558,"title":"Starbucks' mass training will focus on 'implicit bias': ADL chief","summary":"Hoping to quell calls for a national boycott, Starbucks stands to lose millions of dollars by shutting down thousands of stores for one afternoon in May to train employees on how to avoid racial bias after two black men were arrested at a Philadelphia shop for doing nothing more than sitting at a table. While the coffee giant has just started working to create a curriculum for the mass training of more than 170,000 employees, one of the advisers Starbucks has brought in to help said the coffee giant must swiftly show the world it's serious. Police officers monitor activity outside as protestors demonstrate inside a Center City Starbucks, where two black men were arrested, in Philadelphia, April 16, 2018. \"I can tell you that it is a very consequential decision to close all of those stores and provide all of those employees with training.","published_at":1524420559,"content_id":"16287304-a3d6-369f-873c-bca4772b8acc","content_url":"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/News\/starbucks-mass-training-controversial-arrests-focus-implicit-bias\/story?id=54638486","content_published_at":1524373200,"content_time":1524373200,"content_relative_time":42,"reaction_count":2,"vibe_name":"Starbucks","vibe_id":"94164ff6-8e84-35cd-a080-04e6fd60deef","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":42,"comment_relative_time":42,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false}]);
