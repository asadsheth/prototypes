Casey the crocodile on Goat Island \u201cIt was something that had a high probability of happening sometime,\u201d Mr Hansen told ABC News. \"She's not doing something wrong, she's just doing what crocs do. In the early days she actually had a go at me a couple of times. These days I just throw food out from up the top and no-one is allowed to walk down there.\" Mr Hansen runs the Goat Island Lodge, a ramshackle lodge on the crocodile-infested Adelaide River, south of Darwin in the Northern Territory.\u00a0 Guests captured footage of the dog being eaten and could be heard gasping and yelling expletives. A crocodile expert, Adam Britton, said the creature should not be destroyed for eating the dog and may not necessarily attack humans. He said crocodiles which attacked people effectively learnt how to target \u201clarge prey items\u201d. \"The dog got right up close to the crocodile's head,\" Mr Britton told ABC News. \"That basically triggers a reflex reaction, and a crocodile, if you get that close to its head, it doesn't even think about it \u2014 it will just strike. If a crocodile attacks a person it's a little bit different because \u2026 that can potentially lead to it getting [another] large prey item, to put it bluntly.\" Mr Britton said the incident was a reminder to people to stay away from crocodile habitats, particularly if small dogs were present.","published_at":1528356791,"content_id":"c4684566-7d3c-37cc-bee6-c9291fb253bc","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/crocodile-eats-beloved-terrier-spent-121447416.html","content_published_at":1528287287,"content_time":1528287287,"content_relative_time":28,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Pets","vibe_id":"3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":28,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d","post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-47e5f75c-9858-3b15-a47c-2a013724a541_a-cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-47e5f75c-9858-3b15-a47c-2a013724a541_a-cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/queen-meets-hero-medical-dogs-ekkj4bz","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Mail Online","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/femail\/article-5812067\/The-Queen-accompanied-Camilla-attend-dog-charitys-10th-anniversary-celebrations.html","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7iE5K95M80fUhbJZlBTCrw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gbDf4iQdBkl1Wxd8uGwf2w--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d--556538807.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qe90.gufzm4rVldc9ydkag--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zODI7dz02MzY7\/https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gbDf4iQdBkl1Wxd8uGwf2w--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d--556538807.jpeg","height":382,"width":636,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/gbDf4iQdBkl1Wxd8uGwf2w--\/dz02MzY7aD0zODI7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cba575ad-0c87-3fb1-887a-fffc0cdb5a6d--556538807.jpeg","imgw":636,"imgh":382,"title":"Queen meets hero medical dogs and she looks delighted","summary":"The Queen joined the Duchess of Cornwall to see the remarkable work of the country's cancer-detecting dogs first hand today \u2013 and got more of a demonstration than she bargained for.
