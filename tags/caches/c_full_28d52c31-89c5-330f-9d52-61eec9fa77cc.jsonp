What is confusing is that this singularity implies that the space is equal to zero and the time is equally zero! Energy is the manifestation of motions, and how is there no space and time then there is no energy? The primary singularity is an absolute system that can never be triggered and represents nothingness! Then there was simply an explosion and an origin, space, time, matter, energy, breaking the law of energy conservation without any problems? The space can not be expanded into nothing, because nothingness has no dimension of existence! Today's science continues to hold the big beng theory, as the only possible without having any explanation for a pre-explosive state! What happened before the big beng? Second, why the matter is only matter in the universe, and not and the antimatter? Where does the newly created space come from, and in doing so, this creation is accelerating? The theory is wrong, at least from the philosophical point of view. In Einstein's opinion, is ithat is  only sure that nothing can exist? Maybe the solution lies in the fact that the universe did not originate or will ever disappear than it is before the state of eternal existence. As space is not divisible, this infinitely small space can be infinitely large and obviously possess the wave of waves, and the wavelength can be expanded or compacted infinitely. The infinite small space also represents nothingness. The nothingness and space-universe define each other and can not exist separately. It is simply called an eternal state of existence.","message_id":"f1b97733-f797-4bdd-97a0-4a9011646656","context_id":"1b0fb16e-de19-311b-adbb-372a600dcd30","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Srbin","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_S_ald.jpg","author_guid":"LYMZ73VBLS4LX4HJ26VIKSGDT4","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-b3e8045e-3f16-32af-9f5d-f2bee5e319cc_a-1b0fb16e-de19-311b-adbb-372a600dcd30","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/space-300-old-philosophical-battle-43f6v6p","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"The Conversation","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/space-300-old-philosophical-battle-085655850.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_conversation_464\/014df5668d12ceec10c60362462da76e","title":"What is space?

Experts say you may be able to see the icy blue planet with the naked eye, but if not, binoculars should do the trick. NASA says Uranus should be visible all night long and its blue-green color is unmistakable. Where should you look to find Uranus? The experts say start in the southeast sky within the constellation Pisces, the fish. \u201cScan the constellation carefully, and look for a tiny blue-green disk to pop out against the background of fainter stars,\u201d National Geographic Magazine suggests.","published_at":1508437090,"content_id":"f12ba06d-601e-305a-b1e7-908d68a5d257","content_url":"http:\/\/philadelphia.cbslocal.com\/2017\/10\/19\/see-uranus-naked-eye\/","content_published_at":1508435220,"content_relative_time":5,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-9f4dd1b4-e53d-3eea-a4ee-0bfa1a867c4d_a-2b899303-8472-3896-95b6-748f61edafc4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/lunar-cave-could-astronauts-shelter-8310tlx","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"New York Post","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/10\/19\/lunar-cave-could-give-astronauts-shelter-on-the-moon\/","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/hLUR801twiow3CBgOFDT9w--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_2b899303-8472-3896-95b6-748f61edafc4--2107136576.jpeg","title":"Lunar cave could give astronauts shelter on the moon","summary":"Japanese scientists have discovered a massive cave on the moon that could one day serve as shelter for astronauts colonizing our rocky neighbor, according to reports.

That said, even something like a pair of binoculars will be of great assistance in finding Uranus in the inky black of space. Its hard-to-spot nature isn't surprising, especially when you consider that Uranus is something like 1.8 billion miles away from Earth.

It's big, pale, and packed with gas, but we rarely get a chance to actually see it without the use of pricey instruments. Tonight is another story, and thanks to the planet's positioning in relation to our Sun, everyone should be able to get a pretty clear glimpse of it... if that's something you're into. Tonight, as the calendar flips from October 18th to the 19th, Uranus will be in opposition to the Sun, meaning that it'll be on the opposite side of the Earth in relation to our star. That positioning will bathe Uranus in light, and it should be just enough to make the distant planet visible to the naked eye. Tonight will be especially good for viewing Uranus thanks to the new moon, which won't competing for attention in the same area of the sky. That should help in spotting the planet, which will still be just a faint speck, even if you don't have any kind of viewing equipment. That said, even something like a pair of binoculars will be of great assistance in finding Uranus in the inky black of space. Its hard-to-spot nature isn't surprising, especially when you consider that Uranus is something like 1.8 billion miles away from Earth. Even still, it's big enough \u2014 and the Sun's light is strong enough \u2014 to make it visible from this distance. Future exploratory missions of the planet have been proposed, and NASA even has tentative plans to probe the planet in order to learn more about the gasses and elements that make it tick. However, those trips wouldn't be possible until at least 2030. If you're hoping to spot Uranus tonight, you're probably going to need a star chart to figure out exactly where to look. There are a few options available that will be super useful after the sun sets. So get out there, gaze skyward, and enjoy Uranus for all its worth.","published_at":1508340333,"content_id":"d8ca5ccb-ed3d-3506-8fc7-fc13c0576d94","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/ll-great-view-uranus-tonight-won-t-even-152334949.html","content_published_at":1508340214,"content_relative_time":31,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc"},"created_at":1508351944,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":false},{"text":"There will not be a magnetic field to give protection from particles from the sun.

Other telescopes then recorded a faint spot of light -- one that would have otherwise gone unnoticed and has since disappeared on the other side of the sun.\u00a0 These faint signals were turned into an incredible story: Two massive stars in orbit around each other died and collapsed into spheres roughly the size of Manhattan, both of them composed of matter so dense a teaspoonful would","published_at":1508354220,"content_id":"9806bc7a-c5c0-36eb-9321-1e1533ccf3ad","content_url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/view\/articles\/2017-10-18\/how-scientists-watched-the-stars-collide?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=bd&utm_campaign=headline&cmpId=yhoo.headline&yptr=yahoo","content_published_at":1508350247,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-8dc40746-15e2-374c-a4cf-0d442a4464f4_a-f6434468-984b-3524-a58c-17f226708a36","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/nasa-invites-media-attend-10th-annual-wernher-von-17hts09","author":"third_watch","provider":"PR Newswire","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/nasa-invites-media-attend-10th-annual-wernher-von-192000182.html","img":null,"title":"NASA Invites Media to Attend 10th Annual Wernher von Braun Memorial Symposium","summary":"HUNTSVILLE, Ala., Oct. 18, 2017 \/PRNewswire-USNewswire\/ -- NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, invites media to the 10th Annual Wernher von Braun Memorial Symposium, Oct. 25-26, at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.
