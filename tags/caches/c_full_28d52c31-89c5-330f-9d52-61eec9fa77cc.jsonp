Another Exotic Way to Explore the Solar System","summary":"We're all familiar with the idea of solar sails to explore the Solar System, using the light pressure from the Sun. But there's another propulsion system that could harness the power of the Sun, electric sails, and it's a pretty exciting idea. A few weeks ago, I tackled a question someone had about my favorite exotic propulsion systems, and I rattled off a few ideas that I find exciting: solar sails, nuclear rockets, ion engines, etc. But there's another propulsion system that keeps coming up, and I totally forgot to mention, but it's one of the best ideas I've heard in awhile: electric sails. As you probably know, a solar sail works by harnessing the photons of light streaming from the Sun.","published_at":1508878582,"content_id":"6e85874e-0b93-3400-82d5-ed5d59f0b1a4","content_url":"https:\/\/www.universetoday.com\/137609\/electric-sail-another-exotic-way-explore-solar-system\/","content_published_at":1508871638,"content_relative_time":45,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":45,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-c680163f-4f7c-37bb-b95c-d21937c37ab6_a-ef46c306-7210-3336-a472-c1b7a90b6e09","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/exomoons-could-bigger-weirder-nearby-j0rmb6c","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"CNET","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/exomoon-exoplanet-kepler-1625-b-i-moon-earth-nasa\/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b&linkId=43896105","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/rY7DRxt6QgXGOqmdA4ywhA--\/dz02NzA7aD01MDM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ef46c306-7210-3336-a472-c1b7a90b6e09-180418210.jpeg","title":"Exomoons could be bigger and weirder than nearby moons","summary":"Most of the moons we know in our solar system tend to be either rocky or icy, with some weird features like Titan's methane lakes, the hidden oceans of Europa and Enceladus or the volcanic hell of Io.

Officials expect the problem, traced to an electronics package, will delay assembly of the detectors with Euclid's Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer, or NISP, instrument at least 12 months. Equipped with a visible imager and the near-infrared spectrometer, Euclid will generate a three-dimensional map of two billion galaxies, charting their movements through 10 billion years of cosmic history.","published_at":1508825208,"content_id":"532bb435-a846-3fec-859d-f731a8c4d44a","content_url":"https:\/\/astronomynow.com\/2017\/10\/23\/detector-trouble-expected-to-delay-esas-euclid-dark-energy-mission\/","content_published_at":1508742000,"content_relative_time":81,"vibe_name":"Astronomy","vibe_id":"28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":81,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-e1152c70-e4f0-3702-b586-e8b78590ee01_a-b46143f5-30ea-3d76-bacf-736e840c747e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-e1152c70-e4f0-3702-b586-e8b78590ee01_a-b46143f5-30ea-3d76-bacf-736e840c747e","author":"third_watch","provider":"CNN","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/videos\/us\/2017\/10\/23\/stephen-hawking-grand-design-of-universe-sept-2010-lkl-bts.cnn","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/4OoKBsS5H1YeyeP1_cVaLQ--\/dz0xMTAwO2g9NjE5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_b46143f5-30ea-3d76-bacf-736e840c747e--58928976.jpeg","title":"Hawking on the creation of the universe (2010)","summary":"Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.
