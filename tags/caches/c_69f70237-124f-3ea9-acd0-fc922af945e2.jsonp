(Reuters) - Fast-moving wildfires raging across Northern California's wine country have killed 17 people, left about 150 missing and destroyed 1,500 homes, wineries and other structures, state fire officials said on Tuesday. The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said 11 of the fatalities were in its jurisdiction, where 155 people were still missing, although 45 others had been found and some of those unaccounted for may be due to confusion surrounding evacuations. In Napa County, the dead included 100-year-old Charles Rippey and his wife, Sarah,, 98, according to the county sheriff's office.","published_at":1507683638,"content_id":"ff5b9c70-e215-32eb-88b3-ab3eed72e7ba","content_url":"https:\/\/ca.news.yahoo.com\/wildfires-kill-15-destroy-1-500-homes-other-054103475--finance.html","content_published_at":1507700463,"content_relative_time":13,"vibe_name":"World News"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":13,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-328dc39c-97ec-37e0-ad2c-70f84d8a80a8_a-3ee5493c-cd68-3d34-88df-057d773bf4f0","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/mexico-receive-150-million-catastrophe-bond-quake-222708176--business-2h5gb2u","author":"third_watch","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/mexico-receive-150-million-catastrophe-bond-quake-222708176--business.html","img":null,"title":"Mexico to receive $150 million from catastrophe bond after quake","summary":"Mexico's will receive a pay out of $150 million from a catastrophe bond after a Sept. 7 quake met parameters for magnitude, location and depth, the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
