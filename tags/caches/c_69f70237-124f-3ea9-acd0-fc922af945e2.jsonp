I started noticing the small huts these people were living in had roofs made from bags that said USA food aid on the side. I asked around and figured out that the USA has been supporting these people for decades while their own government was exporting the food grown in the south to other countries. I asked how they would feed their 5+ children if the food shipment stopped and they had no clue and were panicking at the thought that that could happen. We are not doing these people any favors by artificially creating an environment were it is OK to have 5+ kids that you cannot feed.
