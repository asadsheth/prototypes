After the cancellation, \"Kim Jong Un got back on his hands and knees and begged for it, which is exactly the position you want to put him in,\" Mr Giuliani told a business conference in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. In an interview later with The Associated Press, Mr Giuliani rejected suggestions that such comments might sour the atmosphere ahead of next week's summit, saying that the North Korean leader must understand that the United States is in a position of strength. \"It is pointing out that the president is the stronger figure,\" Mr Giuliani, who is Mr Trump's lawyer, said. \"And you're not going to have useful negotiations unless he accepts that.\" Mr Giuliani said Mr Trump had no choice but to call off the meeting after the North Koreans insulted Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser John Bolton and threatened \"nuclear annihilation\" of the US. \"President Trump didn't take that. What he did was he called off the summit,\" he said. Donald Trump's lawyer\u00a0Rudy Giuliani\u00a0rejected suggestions that such comments might sour the atmosphere ahead of next week's summit Credit: AFP Mr Giuliani said Mr Kim quickly changed his position, expressed willingness to discuss denuclearisation and asked to have the meeting again. \"That's what I mean by begging for it,\" Mr Giuliani said. The summit is back on in Singapore next Tuesday. Mr Giuliani, the president's lawyer in the Russian investigation, noted that he was sharing a personal opinion and was not part of the US\u00a0foreign policy team. US officials are reportedly drawing up plans for Donald Trump to hold a second day of talks Credit: Getty The announcement came a day after the White House revealed that the historic June 12 meeting between the US and North Korean leaders will take place in a luxury hotel on Singapore's resort island of Sentosa. With preparations for the summit continuing apace,\u00a0 Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan was visiting Pyongyang on Thursday. Balakrishnan, who went to Washington earlier this week, will meet his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, and the president of the Supreme People's Assembly and ceremonial president,\u00a0Kim\u00a0Yong Nam, during his two-day visit to Pyongyang, a government statement said.
