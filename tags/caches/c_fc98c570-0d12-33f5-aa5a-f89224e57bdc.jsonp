The current model for the birth of the universe predicts that equal parts of matter and antimatter were produced by the Big Bang. But, since matter and antimatter are identical except for their opposite electrical charges, they annihilate each other \u2014 a reaction that fuels the starship Enterprise on \u201cStar Trek.\u201d When the two collide, they combust in a violent eruption, meaning none of anything should be here today.

With it's particle-wave duality, and spooky action at a distance, it is a difficult theory to wrap your head around. But long before we were able to test some of its strangest implications, we used hypothetical thought experiments. One of the most famous was the delayed-choice experiment proposed by John Wheeler in 1978. The delayed choice experiment looks at one of the strangest behaviors of quantum systems, specifically that they can sometimes interact like particles, and sometimes like waves. For example, light can behave like a wave, and waves of light can overlap to create interference patterns that can be seen as ripples of bright and dark on a screen.

The fossils, described in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shed light on the nature of ancient forests and the evolution of the Earth's climate. The Xinicaulis lignescens fossils, discovered in Xinjiang, China, are part of a group of species known as Cladoxylopsida \u2014 plants that have no known descendants but are thought to be related to the ancestors of today's ferns and horsetails. Cladoxylopsida emerged in some of Earth's earliest forests, during the Mid- to early Late Devonian period, around 393 million to 372 million years ago.","published_at":1508948864,"content_id":"19eea3b4-3c6d-3af3-94fa-1d3021f3d644","content_url":"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/science\/sciencenow\/la-sci-sn-oldest-trees-forest-20171023-story,amp.html","content_published_at":1508872200,"content_relative_time":45,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":45,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-b39dbcae-3c7e-3316-ab38-6251b46d464b_a-ff0b14b3-6d1a-3d8c-b3dc-c369aad06dac","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/nearly-complete-tyrannosaur-fossil-airlifted-26smhxn","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"The Salt Lake Tribune","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.sltrib.com\/news\/environment\/2017\/10\/15\/nearly-complete-tyrannosaur-fossil-airlifted-from-utahs-grand-staircase\/","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/nayXljAWa4H3a_ZJHyOisQ--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_ff0b14b3-6d1a-3d8c-b3dc-c369aad06dac-883992101.jpeg","title":"Nearly complete tyrannosaur fossil airlifted from Utah's Grand Staircase","summary":"Two years ago, Alan Titus was prospecting for fossils on Utah's Kaiparowits Plateau, searching for new places to unearth paleontological treasures that could reveal secrets about massive and long-extinct land reptiles known as dinosaurs.","published_at":1508949103,"content_id":"ff0b14b3-6d1a-3d8c-b3dc-c369aad06dac","content_url":"http:\/\/www.sltrib.com\/news\/environment\/2017\/10\/15\/nearly-complete-tyrannosaur-fossil-airlifted-from-utahs-grand-staircase\/","content_published_at":1508914800,"content_relative_time":33,"vibe_name":"Science","vibe_id":"fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":33,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-fc98c570-0d12-33f5-aa5a-f89224e57bdc_c-fec94d1e-b5e4-3c6d-a7a5-133d41f58639_a-81d6e554-a3ef-315f-a35d-7d02334f6b5d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/science\/astrolabe-found-shipwreck-worlds-oldest-eq3wna3","author":"third_watch","provider":"New York Post","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/10\/24\/astrolabe-found-in-shipwreck-is-worlds-oldest-navigational-tool\/","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kxtZ6MgBjps158jKt0iYww--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_81d6e554-a3ef-315f-a35d-7d02334f6b5d-1557732877.jpeg","title":"Astrolabe found in shipwreck is 'world's oldest navigational tool'","summary":"An object recovered from a shipwreck off the coast of Oman is believed to be the world's oldest known navigational tool, dating back to 1495, experts said.
