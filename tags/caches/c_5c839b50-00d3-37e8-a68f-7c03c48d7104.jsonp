The Boston Celtics star forward underwent surgery to repair his dislocated ankle and fractured tibia last Wednesday, and while the C's were on the road, head coach Brad Stevens reached out to Hayward to ask if he needed anything. His answer: a basketball. Perhaps Hayward already is practicing form shooting from a chair, as Paul George did when he suffered his traumatic leg injury. Either way, it's good to see Hayward is chomping at the bit to get back to the game anyway that he can.
