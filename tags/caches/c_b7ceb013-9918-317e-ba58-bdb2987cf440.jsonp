Defending the \u201cdigital homeland\u201d must become a key part of the\u00a0work of Britain's electronic spy agency, Jeremy Fleming says in his most extensive public comments since becoming head of the agency earlier this year. The growing task of defending Britain\u2019s online life and commerce means an increasingly prominent role for an agency that has traditionally taken a backseat to MI5 and MI6. Writing in the Telegraph, he says the top secret, Cheltenham-based agency must step out of the shadows of nearly a century of secrecy to better keep people safe and free online. His comments come after a series of high profile cyber attacks, including May\u2019s WannaCry ransomware outbreak that caused chaos to the NHS. Jeremy Fleming was appointed director of GCHQ earlier this year Concerns over the UK\u2019s national cyber security have also been raised by a string of allegedly Russian-backed cyber operations targeting political parties and MPs across Europe. Mr Fleming, said: \u201cIf GCHQ is to continue to help the keep the country safe was we prepare for our second century, then protecting the digital homeland - keeping our citizens safe and free online - must become and remain as much part of our mission as our global intelligence reach and our round-the-clock efforts against terrorism.\u201d His comments come as the Government is reviewing national security policy in the wake of increased terrorism, cyber attacks and Russian activity.\u00a0 First look inside GCHQ: The home of Britain's spy network 01:02 Mr Fleming joined GCHQ in April after a career at the Security Service, MI5. The Government last year launched the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a high-profile offshoot from GCHQ drawing on the agency\u2019s expertise to protect the nation\u2019s online life. Mr Fleming said his staff were \u201cprotecting the nation from those who want to use the internet to cause harm\u201d. \u201cWe all derive great benefit from the ease and speed of connecting across the planet: access to knowledge, reduced costs of communication and commerce, and from the additional security provided by default encryption. \u201cIt\u2019s also true to say that hostile states, terrorists and criminals use the same features to undermine our national security, attack our interests and, increasingly, to commit crime.\u201d In its first year, the NCSC tackled 600 significant cyber attacks on bodies ranging from key national institutions to large and small businesses. The WannaCry outbreak affected dozens of NS trusts, while in June email accounts were targeted in an attack on parliamentary networks. GCHQ celebrates its centenary in 2019, but the work of its technical experts, engineers, analysts, translators and codebreakers has been kept secret throughout its history. Mr Fleming said the agency\u2019s new role would require a higher profile, collaborating more openly with industry. He said: \u201cAll of this can feel deeply challenging for a GCHQ that by necessity has worked in the shadows. It remains the case that much of what we do must remain secret. But the success of the NCSC demonstrates that we are more effective, a better employer and more trusted if we are more transparent, more visible and take advantage of the internet to drive change.\u201d","published_at":1507507809,"content_id":"7eecf31e-5493-3150-acd9-9d8a25f3d7ed","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/defending-uk-apos-digital-homeland-210000036.html","content_published_at":1507496400,"content_relative_time":69,"vibe_name":"InfoSec"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":69,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ceb013-9918-317e-ba58-bdb2987cf440_c-b1d34184-34a9-3415-8a86-d5e13992e015_a-d9073884-edba-3811-8917-5ab53a94f657","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/infosec\/officials-push-cybersecurity-education-amid-5jkg20i","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"DeseretNews.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.deseretnews.com\/article\/865690695\/Officials-push-cybersecurity-education-amid-rise-in-malicious-attacks.html","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/vFw5w9rfFgG7SnQPG5ejhg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_d9073884-edba-3811-8917-5ab53a94f657--792721301.jpeg","title":"Officials push cybersecurity education amid rise in malicious attacks","summary":"SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Digital security breaches that impact megacompanies like Equifax, Sony or Yahoo tend to dominate headlines when they occur, but it's far more common for small businesses to fall victim to cybercriminals and, when they do, the results are typically far more catastrophic. That's why local organizations like the Salt Lake Chamber and Utah Department of Public Safety are joining the FBI, U.S. Department of Homeland Security and others staging numerous events throughout the coming weeks in support of October as Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Research reported by Microsoft estimates business losses due to cybercrime have topped $3 trillion and could hit $6 trillion by 2021.

Although Pornhub, the world's largest pornography site with 26bn yearly visits according to data from ranking firm Alexa, and its advertising network have shut down the infection pathway, the attack is still ongoing on other sites. The hack was carried out by a group known as KovCoreG, Proofpoint said, who hoped to infect users with an ad fraud malware known as Kovter.
