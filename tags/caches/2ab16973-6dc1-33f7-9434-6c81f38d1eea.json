The power of immersive technologies to enhance learning is something we've covered a lot here on Tech Trends in the past, and we only really started to scratch the surface of what is possible there. It of course takes extensive (and very intensive) training for astronauts to learn how to handle any situations and potential emergencies that could arise in space. This is why it makes sense to leverage VR tech to practice and imprint correct responses to a variety of high-pressure scenarios that that they might encounter\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is exactly what BlueTea, a Dutch developer of modular 3D training simulations is doing.","published_at":1507638492,"content_id":"08bb24e9-2e1b-3727-a27f-7ec3cfc8e7ad","content_url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@alicebonasio\/sending-astronauts-into-orbit-with-virtual-reality-25a891752a65","content_published_at":1507632197,"content_relative_time":32,"vibe_name":"Virtual Reality"},{"post_id":"v-2ab16973-6dc1-33f7-9434-6c81f38d1eea_c-b191e94b-f867-34a8-a69f-85adc3ab2d11_a-105ddde0-5980-3441-9da9-e933e92cc060","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/virtual-reality\/san-francisco-virtual-reality-360-5wz4lns","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Medium","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/medium.com\/silicon-valley-global-news\/san-francisco-virtual-reality-360-3a5a47ea600e","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/wN0AyI15.JXVyBv9Jsz_Mw--\/dz05OTc7aD02MDE7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_105ddde0-5980-3441-9da9-e933e92cc060-1064657952.jpeg","title":"San Francisco Virtual Reality 360 \u2013 Silicon Valley Global News SVGN.io","summary":"SFVR360 is a series of monthly talks with demos that we are going to host at River Ecosystem in San Francisco.
