Carmen and Armando Berriz were married for 55 years and according to SF Gate, the husband and wife clung to each other in a pool for hours as well, until Carmen stopped breathing and passed in Armando's arms. Their family had been in Santa Rosa on vacation, and after their son, Luis Ocon, noticed flames were encroaching their residence, everyone evacuated as quickly as possible. \u00a0 Armando tripped on a tree which slowed him and his wife down considerably, so much so that their best option was to return to the home and find refuge in the pool. Armando was able to walk two miles to find a firefighter, and was reunited with his family.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s had a rough time,\u201d Luis Ocon told SF Gate, explaining that Armando was back in his home in Apple Valley. \u201cBut he\u2019s unbelievably strong.\u201d You can read more about the life of Carmen Berriz here, and you can learn more about how you can support victims of the fires here.\u00a0 WATCH: The science behind the fast-moving wildfires that are devastating California","published_at":1507915174,"content_id":"669121c0-e53a-3d87-8ffc-60f9c09bc786","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/two-families-hid-pools-during-182226543.html","content_published_at":1507918946,"content_relative_time":4,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2"},"created_at":1507930160,"comment_relative_time":1,"bot":false},{"text":"My brother is in the Navy but if we can not stop a huge tanker from slamming us how in the hell can we stop a tarpedo from blowing us out the water?","message_id":"cfaf57d7-56b5-466f-8f8e-34c9fe6f774e","context_id":"c6c4d77b-662c-36fe-88d6-642ab768bd12","upvotes":3,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Yahawha","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_Y_kl.jpg","author_guid":"PPB5JGA3CZMSQQ4QCV7UK3GZ2Y","score":0.54601868157123,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-de28eb09-3164-3954-a435-561135ced317_a-c6c4d77b-662c-36fe-88d6-642ab768bd12","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/u-military-sends-war-ship-6huo0vm","author":"nanook","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/u-military-sends-war-ship-194923172.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/ce096d40135c66486a2fea38c3d29aff","title":"U.S. Military Sends Warship to North Korea Region Amid Missile Threats","summary":"The U.S. Navy is sending\u00a0the USS Monterey,\u00a0a guided-missile destroyer with ballistic missile defense (BMD) capabilities, to East Asia to bolster America\u2019s defenses there amid threats from North Korea.

Armando was able to walk two miles to find a firefighter, and was reunited with his family.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s had a rough time,\u201d Luis Ocon told SF Gate, explaining that Armando was back in his home in Apple Valley. \u201cBut he\u2019s unbelievably strong.\u201d You can read more about the life of Carmen Berriz here, and you can learn more about how you can support victims of the fires here.\u00a0 WATCH: The science behind the fast-moving wildfires that are devastating California","published_at":1507915174,"content_id":"669121c0-e53a-3d87-8ffc-60f9c09bc786","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/two-families-hid-pools-during-182226543.html","content_published_at":1507918946,"content_relative_time":4,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2"},"created_at":1507930809,"comment_relative_time":1,"bot":false},{"text":"Nobody in the family, whether by blood or marriage, looks to be very intelligent...","message_id":"756f3523-58a4-4d69-be63-5aceb4202f42","context_id":"54df939c-a95c-3086-9939-783e27924d59","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Oopsey","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/cdc4ae2ecd0cebf4a6fc1977922c8c65_192.png","author_guid":"3J3QE4HNCBBV45IGTQAW2LM7AU","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-4bc6a4cb-4be6-3654-976c-a91333caaab8_a-54df939c-a95c-3086-9939-783e27924d59","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/father-woman-held-captive-pakistan-1ozxj0b","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"People","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/father-woman-held-captive-pakistan-135451875.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/people_218\/1af97cca0efc7a06ce13fdf4bf05605e","title":"Father of Woman Held Captive in Pakistan with Family Slams Husband for Bringing Her to the Region","summary":"Family of Couple Held Captive in Pakistan Speaks Out","published_at":1507913973,"content_id":"54df939c-a95c-3086-9939-783e27924d59","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/father-woman-held-captive-pakistan-135451875.html","content_published_at":1507902891,"content_relative_time":9,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2"},"created_at":1507932375,"comment_relative_time":1,"bot":false},{"text":"should have kept a 650 ship fleet   for years. did no one see this on its way.","message_id":"d61f6673-35d1-430f-aed0-4827e9ca93ec","context_id":"c6c4d77b-662c-36fe-88d6-642ab768bd12","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"jay","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"M5BEJXZYARHYEWI6CPQ6EKKG34","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-de28eb09-3164-3954-a435-561135ced317_a-c6c4d77b-662c-36fe-88d6-642ab768bd12","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/u-military-sends-war-ship-6huo0vm","author":"nanook","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/u-military-sends-war-ship-194923172.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/ce096d40135c66486a2fea38c3d29aff","title":"U.S. Military Sends Warship to North Korea Region Amid Missile Threats","summary":"The U.S. Navy is sending\u00a0the USS Monterey,\u00a0a guided-missile destroyer with ballistic missile defense (BMD) capabilities, to East Asia to bolster America\u2019s defenses there amid threats from North Korea.

We landed in Nairobi and everything was green and food was everywhere. We then got on a small plane and flew to northern Kenya. It was a desert of rocks and small bushes and people were fighting each other to get  small bags of corn we were passing out. I started noticing the small huts these people were living in had roofs made from bags that said USA food aid on the side. I asked around and figured out that the USA has been supporting these people for decades while their own government was exporting the food grown in the south to other countries. I asked how they would feed their 5+ children if the food shipment stopped and they had no clue and were panicking at the thought that that could happen.

Their family had been in Santa Rosa on vacation, and after their son, Luis Ocon, noticed flames were encroaching their residence, everyone evacuated as quickly as possible. \u00a0 Armando tripped on a tree which slowed him and his wife down considerably, so much so that their best option was to return to the home and find refuge in the pool. Armando was able to walk two miles to find a firefighter, and was reunited with his family.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s had a rough time,\u201d Luis Ocon told SF Gate, explaining that Armando was back in his home in Apple Valley. \u201cBut he\u2019s unbelievably strong.\u201d You can read more about the life of Carmen Berriz here, and you can learn more about how you can support victims of the fires here.\u00a0 WATCH: The science behind the fast-moving wildfires that are devastating California","published_at":1507915174,"content_id":"669121c0-e53a-3d87-8ffc-60f9c09bc786","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/two-families-hid-pools-during-182226543.html","content_published_at":1507918946,"content_relative_time":4,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2"},"created_at":1507926383,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"Yep, There goes Trump making \"W\" look like a genius.

Their family had been in Santa Rosa on vacation, and after their son, Luis Ocon, noticed flames were encroaching their residence, everyone evacuated as quickly as possible. \u00a0 Armando tripped on a tree which slowed him and his wife down considerably, so much so that their best option was to return to the home and find refuge in the pool. Armando was able to walk two miles to find a firefighter, and was reunited with his family.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s had a rough time,\u201d Luis Ocon told SF Gate, explaining that Armando was back in his home in Apple Valley. \u201cBut he\u2019s unbelievably strong.\u201d You can read more about the life of Carmen Berriz here, and you can learn more about how you can support victims of the fires here.\u00a0 WATCH: The science behind the fast-moving wildfires that are devastating California","published_at":1507915174,"content_id":"669121c0-e53a-3d87-8ffc-60f9c09bc786","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/two-families-hid-pools-during-182226543.html","content_published_at":1507918946,"content_relative_time":4,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2"},"created_at":1507926567,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"Corruption a huge reason why people are going hungry, the resources are there.","message_id":"8cb966b8-964d-48f9-a6dc-e9272605cc8e","context_id":"c446c2f9-eda5-30a4-ba37-e401dfcda37e","upvotes":25,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Steven","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_S_jd_1_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"POEJTJSERDPZZUPUDTUH5ATTMU","score":0.85988613008531,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-685adeca-106b-334e-b34d-e8df3c8ba4ad_a-c446c2f9-eda5-30a4-ba37-e401dfcda37e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/famine-threatening-4-countries-casts-shadow-over-global-001406855--abc-news-topstories-9y00y9j","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Good Morning America","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/gma\/famine-threatening-4-countries-casts-shadow-over-global-001406855--abc-news-topstories.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/gma\/us.abcnews.gma.com\/somalia-famine-gty-rc-171012_16x9_992.jpg","title":"Famine threatening 4 countries casts shadow over global hunger progress","summary":"The overall score of the 2017 Global Hunger Index released Thursday is 27 percent lower than the score 17 years ago, which indicates the world has made strides in reducing hunger and increasing food security. \u201cThe results of this year\u2019s Global Hunger Index show that we cannot waver in our resolve to reach the U.N.

Warning that he might ultimately terminate the agreement, Trump's move was a major change in U.S. foreign policy at a time when his administration is also in a crisis with North Korea over that country's nuclear ambitions. It was the second time in two days that Trump took aim at the legacy of his predecessor Barack Obama after signing an executive order on Thursday to weaken the Democratic former president's signature healthcare reform.","published_at":1507924215,"content_id":"4c57fd6a-7d75-3107-8971-31e3f9178bb8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/president-trump-decertify-iran-nuclear-deal-major-shift-153624871.html","content_published_at":1507933038,"content_relative_time":0,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2"},"created_at":1507917874,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":false},{"text":"Surprised Mayor Lee hasn't instituted a breathing tax.","message_id":"268bfc8d-33c9-4a93-9e90-480afd568101","context_id":"d6743145-d70f-34ad-8a93-04e13adcc647","upvotes":180,"downvotes":70,"reports":0,"replies":8,"author_name":"steven","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_S_jd_1_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"S7PI5UNGISQUGP27YD3TP7EC3U","score":0.74103871008103,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-7b6ad629-1a86-3d23-8809-4dc996aa6686_a-d6743145-d70f-34ad-8a93-04e13adcc647","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/wildfires-create-worst-air-quality-san-francisco-bay-2f7ttoj","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/wildfires-create-worst-air-quality-san-francisco-bay-075011692.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/ap_webfeeds\/d6d6c0c388474e84866c14bea64465fb.jpg","title":"San Francisco Bay Area cancels events as smoke chokes region","summary":"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Smoke from the wildfires north of San Francisco plunged air quality levels in the Bay Area to the same unhealthy level as China's notoriously polluted capital, sending people to emergency rooms and forcing schools to close and people to wear masks when they step outside.","published_at":1507880833,"content_id":"d6743145-d70f-34ad-8a93-04e13adcc647","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/wildfires-create-worst-air-quality-san-francisco-bay-075011692.html","content_published_at":1507925126,"content_relative_time":3,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2"},"created_at":1507907378,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":false},{"text":"Can't imagine what hat was like.","message_id":"f3b3dd21-2e65-4ac0-a80f-72a1388168f7","context_id":"669121c0-e53a-3d87-8ffc-60f9c09bc786","upvotes":15,"downvotes":4,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Nick","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_N_jl.jpg","author_guid":"TADKTEY5G3V45QH3HN2T73GEGA","score":0.73977673352949,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-fd7b3299-da50-38df-bc73-853d100363b9_a-669121c0-e53a-3d87-8ffc-60f9c09bc786","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/two-families-hid-pools-during-4u0xp42","author":"third_watch","provider":"Mashable","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/two-families-hid-pools-during-182226543.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/news.mashable\/dfe30b98f5978950981f079d5acee6a5","title":"Two families hid in pools during the California fires, and their stories end in very different ways","summary":"The wildfires ravaging California have been devastating this week, with over 30 people dead so far and countless of homes have been destroyed.\u00a0 While countless of stories are coming from the Golden State, two families shared horrifying accounts of hiding in their respective pools for safety until the flames have passed.\u00a0 SEE ALSO: California wildfire victims returning to their destroyed homes is absolutely heart-wrenching \"In my na\u00efvet\u00e9, all night long,\u201d Jan Pascoe told the LA Times, \"I thought someone would come to get us.\"\u00a0 The 65-year-old was trapped with her 70-year-old husband, John, for six hours, hiding in the pool after their attempt to evacuate was met with \"a wall of flames\" and were forced to turn back.\u00a0 \"I just kept going under,\u201d she told the newspaper. \"And I kept saying, \u2018How long does it take for a house to burn down?\u2019 We were freezing.\"\u00a0 Once the fire passed, they managed to escape. \u201cWe held hands,\u201d John explained, \u201cand walked out.\u201d\u00a0 Despite the close call, the Pascoes both survived and were reunited with their children shortly after the fire had passed.

Emails, texts, and phone calls are sent out to the communities warning of a fire by the police. Most people are sleeping. Many people are awaken by the police and firefighters and have little time to get to safety. Many times the roads are blocked by fire trucks. The winds are blowing the cars around and covering the cars with smoke and embers. The temperature is hot enough to kill people.

Armando was able to walk two miles to find a firefighter, and was reunited with his family.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s had a rough time,\u201d Luis Ocon told SF Gate, explaining that Armando was back in his home in Apple Valley. \u201cBut he\u2019s unbelievably strong.\u201d You can read more about the life of Carmen Berriz here, and you can learn more about how you can support victims of the fires here.\u00a0 WATCH: The science behind the fast-moving wildfires that are devastating California","published_at":1507915174,"content_id":"669121c0-e53a-3d87-8ffc-60f9c09bc786","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/two-families-hid-pools-during-182226543.html","content_published_at":1507918946,"content_relative_time":4,"vibe_name":"World News","vibe_id":"69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2"},"created_at":1507925900,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"It shows the USA is not trust worthy.We've lost international influence and credibility throughout the Middle East, Asia and Europe.","message_id":"e65c0f76-6915-4a66-a034-48e8fb53bdd1","context_id":"1b2c6072-128a-32e3-8edf-a7f6a21cb5f1","upvotes":113,"downvotes":58,"reports":1,"replies":7,"author_name":"Da","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ad.jpg","author_guid":"IFDPYV4EKOKQ7MC5F5CN3PMVVE","score":0.65227881741219,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-68277b69-a373-3571-ba5b-9c655f467d97_a-1b2c6072-128a-32e3-8edf-a7f6a21cb5f1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/trump-calls-changing-killing-iran-nuclear-deal-whats-next-2ex663g","author":"nanook","provider":"Yahoo News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-calls-changing-killing-iran-nuclear-deal-whats-next-194932835.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/4618d3069ad86a705b22463f6433bddf","title":"Trump calls for changing,\u00a0or killing, Iran nuclear deal.

All of their belongings were demolished in the fire. Unfortunately, the Berriz family had a very different ending to their story.

This damaged relations to the point North Korea believe the US would never honor any agreement they made at the table, understandably so.\n\nNow, we have a Secretary of State who has had open conflict with the President. It is tough for a foreign nation to believe that Tillerson holds the President's ear anymore, and have little incentive to sitting with him to make a deal. We also have a President who has decided to pull out and ignore numerous longstanding deals and negotiations (NAFTA, The Paris Agreement, NATO, TPP, etc)\n\nPulling out of the Iran deal could be the final step to North Korea realizing there will never be any diplomatic relations with the US and the only response will be war.\n\n(Source: https:\/\/www.armscontrol.org\/factsheets\/agreedframework)","message_id":"22d18572-263d-4591-bc53-612fab75316f","context_id":"71d6568d-0d84-391d-8929-76d2bdcc6328","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Mike Stafstrom","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_M_ald.jpg","author_guid":"YQL5FKGJ52JSAF45HXBGDZMBFI","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-17cdf1b0-0460-3862-8ac3-3949d5a23b42_a-71d6568d-0d84-391d-8929-76d2bdcc6328","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/america-could-subdue-north-korea-40qxeyk","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"The National Interest","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/america-could-subdue-north-korea-000900177.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_national_interest_705\/b34dbc360bbb38fb38b3320d72eeea1b","title":"America Could Subdue North Korea's Nuclear Threats with a Not-So-Grand Bargain","summary":"A double-freeze deal will not be satisfying to either U.S. or North Korean leaders, but it still reduces tensions and the risk of accidental nuclear war.
