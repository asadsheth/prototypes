Features reclaimed or created from land which appear above water when low tide and submerged in water when high tide do have 500 meters of safety water around them. However, the UNCLOS short of telling us whether these features have sovereignty or not. When we say features created from low tide elevations, we mean these creatures are located in a coastal country's Exclusive Economic Zone. It is not any feature created in the high seas, as most ignorant commentators displayed their dotard IQ here. China's reclamation of islands in the South China Sea appear to be within the context of the UNCLOS. There are two groups of reclaimed features by China. One group is island reclaimed from high tide elevations. This group of islands certainly has 12 nautical miles of sovereignty waters. Another group of islands is created from low tide elevations. These islands may or may not have 12 nm of territorial seas. If this group of islands is located with the 12 nm of territorial seas of another island or groups of islands, certainly these island also are entitled to have territorial seas. Both the Chinese and the Americans know this very well. My though is that Americans may not even care about this part of the international law, but China does. On the other hand, China is not in a hurry to make a big fuss of it. China may be just interested in collecting more data\/information about any American ship that passes around these islands. I believe that China might have submerged systems to collect data from ships that pass by. These could be data collection systems or some may well be weapons.

In a policy paper last year, the European Commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation EU, said that countries such as Iran could contribute to that goal.\n\nThe deal would cover five areas: oil and natural gas contracts, renewables and energy efficiency, power markets, energy infrastructure and direct investment in Iran\u2019s energy industry.\n\nEuropean politicians and business leaders, resembling the running of the bulls in Spain, are falling over themselves in a rush to secure the \"first-mover\" advantage in Iran's $400 billion economy.\n\nIranian officials say that investments of $185 billion are required in the oil and gas sector alone during the next five years. The mining sector requires $29 billion between now and 2025. Iran hopes to triple the number of cars manufactured in the country to three million a year by 2025.\n\nSanctions will also be lifted on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's $95 billion business empire, as well as on Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which operates a vast network of companies and industries.\n\nNo wonder that European media outlets are referring to Iran as the \"new El Dorado,\" the \"chance of a century,\" and the \"last untapped market.\"\n\nAlthough the United States Congress will not vote on the accord until September, Europeans appear to be operating on the premise that Iran is now open for business.\n\n--------------------------\n\nIran's dealmaking with Europe: the seven biggest contracts\nDeals worth nearly \u20ac40bn were struck during the Iranian president\u2019s four-day visit to Europe after the lifting of sanctions\nAirbus \u20ac22bn (\u00a316.8bn)\nDanieli \u20ac5.7bn\nSaipem \u20ac3.5bn\nPeugeot \u20ac400m\nTotal \u20ac6.6m at current prices\nA\u00e9roports de Paris and Bouygues\nVinci","id":"5b7c1f92-9823-4303-9d1e-15878379f2cc","context_id":"531933e7-7c1d-3650-aa6f-e2051ea1106f","upvotes":2,"downvotes":1,"reports":1,"replies":0,"author_name":"Unicorn","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_U_ald_6-16.jpg","score":0.24014433884993,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-7e27d62b-5f18-3639-a73f-091b5bdb437f_a-531933e7-7c1d-3650-aa6f-e2051ea1106f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/fearing-trump-torpedo-europe-scrambles-save-iran-deal-142619175--sector-1484r0b","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/fearing-trump-torpedo-europe-scrambles-save-iran-deal-142619175--sector.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2017-10-11T143634Z_2_LYNXMPED9A16S_RTROPTP_2_IRAN-NUCLEAR-EUROPE.JPG","title":"Fearing Trump torpedo, Europe scrambles to save Iran deal","summary":"By Noah Barkin and John Irish BERLIN\/PARIS (Reuters) - European countries are scrambling to cobble together a package of measures they hope will keep the Iran nuclear deal on track if U.S. President Donald Trump ignores their pleas and decertifies the landmark 2015 agreement this week.
