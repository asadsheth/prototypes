Pffff, I am not saying anything more about this useless measure.\nTravel ban for SOME Islamic countries ? Either the Islamic people (or at least an indiscernible part of them) are the enemy - then I need to block them ALL, and not just some. Or not - then the travel ban is complete nonsense. Either way, it will not help. On the contrary, it just makes more people thinking hostile thoughts increasing the chances that somebody from that \"side\" tries something stupid. And they can, if they want. The simplest way is to use a different country.\nWall to Mexico ? As existing pieces of walls and fences show - no effect. They dig tunnels. The real garbage from there comes into our country not by just walking across the border in the desert or something like this, but by regularly crossing the border at regular checkpoints, by airplanes, ships and by using these tunnels. That's why I always said, if such a wall wants to have a chance to make any positive impact, it is not important how high it is, but how deep it goes into the ground. Instead of 30 ft high and going 5ft under ground, it would be better to reverse this. To go 30-50ft below to prevent those tunnels. But then they will get real tunnel engineers and build even deeper ones. At least it would really cost them and be painful.\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, you see, I am not even talking about the question, if the intent is good or bad. Just by accepting the communicated intent the chosen measures will not help at all. They just cost money and give some people a chance to pretend that they did something to improve our security and\/or quality of life.","message_id":"cfb2a36a-92d0-41cc-ba42-4566c6b0040f","context_id":"866e83ec-0706-3b62-9c38-31cd30c7a53a","upvotes":1,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Reinhard","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_ald.jpg","author_guid":"MHPUYVHJTHAUFHY7FZF6AYCMZ4","score":0.37768959125474,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-96487e89-f880-3eb5-a109-c24fe796b190_a-866e83ec-0706-3b62-9c38-31cd30c7a53a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/world-news\/v-69f70237-124f-3ea9-acd0-fc922af945e2_c-96487e89-f880-3eb5-a109-c24fe796b190_a-866e83ec-0706-3b62-9c38-31cd30c7a53a","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"AFP","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/passenger-security-checks-us-bound-flights-154713808.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/Part-WAS-Was3504122-1-1-0.jpg","title":"US-bound passengers face new security interviews at check-in","summary":"US-bound travelers will face security interviews before checking in to flights at a number of global airlines beginning Thursday as anti-terror measures are stepped up around the world.
