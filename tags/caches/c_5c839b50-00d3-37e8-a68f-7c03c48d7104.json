When the team begins to think they are more important than the Nation then changes must occur. Dan Rooney is a disgrace to his Grandfather's memory. Mike Tomlin must go and there needs to be wholesale changes on the team. What is even worse is they tried to change the story about the real reason for the protest. They said it was not political and that is exactly what it was. Cam Heywood's statement that they took a vote to protest what the President said did not coincide with the crafted Management and Team statement once they realized how badly this was taken by the Fans, so they erased it from the record and the internet as if it never happened. They closed ranks and covered up and never admitted they were wrong by offering an apology. There are plenty of good wide receivers, running backs,etc that love this County and would love the opportunity to play professional football. Get rid of the management and Coach that allowed, if not encouraged this and maybe fans will return.
