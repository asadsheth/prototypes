He is under team control for this and next season and has zero leverage to tell the team anything.  Offensive lineman Ramon Foster has also made comments that indicate that Bryant is feeling the heat from his girlfriend and possibly family to try to cash out and try to get a big deal. They believe if he gets cut or traded he can latch onto another team and become a superstar with a massive contract. What Bryant needs to realize is that with his suspension history and inconsistent play he needs to show up to work, shut up, and prove on the field he can be counted on before the big money comes his way.  He is getting very bad advice from those who clearly have an agenda and monetary stake on his career in the NFL.  Quite frankly if he doesn't wise up the Steelers should let him rot on the bench for the next few seasons until his deal is up or possibly look for into a trade that can bring something of value in return to help them win now.  Pryor has been feeling some heat in Washington and has been benched.  He only has a 1 year deal and Washington may be willing to make a deal.  If Washington if willing to listen I trade like that at least should be considered.

As a little kid the only team they showed on TV back then was the 49ers. So from my first memories was sitting down every Sunday (When not at church) watching the 49ers with my dad. Then in 1962 we moved to Santa Cruz California (75 miles south of SF). My dad took me to my first football game out at Kezar stadium in the Height area. We saw 49ers VS Rams. All I remember was the rivalry between the fans. There were a few Ram fans and all I remember were a lot of fights. Also went out and saw the Colts with Johnny Unitas. Winning was scarce until The Brodie years (1970-1974). Then along came Walsh in 1978. Me and my buddie put in for season tickets at Candlestick Park in 1979. We got them and had them from 1980 to 1995. Best Tailgate parties in the world. I was there when Clark made \"The Catch\". That changed everything. One thing about Clark is he was not that fast but I don't think I had seen anyone catch him once he was ahead of someone. He knew how to turn it on. To me the 3 greatest 49ers ever were Montana, Rice and Clark. I guess I would have to include Walsh as the greatest Coach I had ever seen outside of Lombardi. Without Clark I really don't think the 49ers would of been that great until Rice showed up. What a terrible thing to happen to a great person and player.

Ban replay altogether because occasionally there is a close call that the author disagrees with?  Every week, replay is used to overturn many obvious bad calls.  A receiver pretends to make a 30-yard catch when the ball skips on the ground -- if no ref is in position to clearly see the ball skip, then we're going to let that \"reception\" stand?  A punt returner steps out of bounds on his own 25 yard line but the ref doesn't see it, and he goes on to run for 75 more yards and a TD... should that stand?  \n\nThe author is probably a millennial who doesn't remember what life was like before replay.  Fans had to watch helplessly as their team would lose a game because the refs didn't see a guy step out of bounds or because they didn't realize a runner was down before he fumbled.  At least now, we can correct the obvious ones.  \n\nAs far as the standard of \"indisputable\" evidence, that's in the eye of the beholder.  Personally, I think the call on the Tate reception was correct, and I understand why they reversed that one.  Yes, I get that there are counter-arguments, but I think they are a reach -- I think the counter-argument is based on someone trying too hard to see something there that isn't there.  When you look at the reception in real time, it's easy to see why the ref might call it a TD, as Tate falls into the end zone.  When you look at it on replay, it's easy to see why they'd conclude he was down by contact at the one-foot line.  I have no problem with the way that played out -- and I'm not a fan of either team involved.  Atlanta fans would've had a legitimate gripe if the TD were allowed to stand; Detroit fans have a gripe that it was overturned.  Personally, I think it was handled appropriately, and I blame the Lions for running a play with no timeouts that had a chance of being short of the goal line.","message_id":"2073d069-d24b-490f-8f43-96e58d32e7d3","context_id":"0e53bb22-4bf4-3260-bd08-f997b41141f3","upvotes":42,"downvotes":5,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"Kevin","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_K_ald.jpg","author_guid":"AJM2OSYGKKBUZH4IWCS4PHPZZA","score":0.86787312892929,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-f9b84e36-6d73-3f92-9f62-d4bfdec8dec1_a-0e53bb22-4bf4-3260-bd08-f997b41141f3","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/__trashed-24-1uo6bhr","author":"nanook","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/__trashed-24-192538900.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/9d01486a6eee218c47ce9bd2158a8880","title":"NFL refs and instant replay are destroying the league","summary":"Instant replay is supposed to make things better in the NFL.

Remember when Ben criticized (challenged) him for dropping passes all the time and he caught that amazing pass in the end zone after doing a flip and between his legs? he probably wants to make up for lost time during last years suspension to prove that he is elite, but hes not getting enough passes. lets face it...he has the potential to be a legend. he just needs to follow his role.

The Boston Celtics star forward underwent surgery to repair his dislocated ankle and fractured tibia last Wednesday, and while the C's were on the road, head coach Brad Stevens reached out to Hayward to ask if he needed anything. His answer: a basketball. Perhaps Hayward already is practicing form shooting from a chair, as Paul George did when he suffered his traumatic leg injury. Either way, it's good to see Hayward is chomping at the bit to get back to the game anyway that he can.
