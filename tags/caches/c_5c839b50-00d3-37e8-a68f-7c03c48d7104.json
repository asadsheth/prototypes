[{"text":"this writer is an idiot.\nWhat Garvey means is that they are playing the game like impatient children. Not manufacturing runs by playing 'small ball', etc. He is calling out millennial weenies for swinging for the fences, expecting immediate gratification, etc.\nAnd by the way , a strikeout is different from a 'regular ' out in many cases. What is a 'regular' out, anyway - just not a strikeout? So, if you strike out with no outs and a man on third, it is no different than a long fly out? Or a sac bunt to move a man along.","message_id":"f5a70905-0197-48b5-a504-e78090589ddc","context_id":"e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","upvotes":6,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"learyj","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_L_ad.jpg","author_guid":"5VTPIXWNKKIOXXGA4M3X6KZN2E","score":0.71911575945596,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-e5c84c07-8f22-3ab7-af63-321f06ea9ef7_a-e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-2grj56q","author":"nanook","provider":"Big League Stew","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-074225129.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/f4ab9bfea644312d84345795fb1f768d","title":"Steve Garvey blames Dodgers loss in Game 2 on 'Millennial baseball'","summary":"Those dang Millennials are ruining baseball now according to Dodgers legend Steve Garvey.","published_at":1508998086,"content_id":"e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-074225129.html","content_published_at":1509003745,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"Sports","vibe_id":"5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104"},"created_at":1509033079,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"43 year old reflexes and reaction time.

I'm now the old guy that cant stand flat brims or crooked hats.  However, Garvey is not wrong in his assessment.  Sure Home Runs are an important part of the game.  Dave Kingman, Dale Murphy, Mark McGuire, and Jose Canseo are all examples of players in the 80's that were known for risk reward fence swinging.  However, taking a few strikes when you are down by two runs is baseball common sense.  Putting the ball in play is indeed better than a strikeout. Always allow your opponent to make the mental or physical error rather than you.  Now, if you have a hitter count go ahead and dig in and hack away.  Otherwise, Garvey is accurate when it comes to playoff baseball.  A perfect example is game 7 of the 2001 world series when the best closer in baseball history (Rivera) blew a save to the base to base Diamondbacks to lose the World series.

I thought to myself then Dodgers should do a squeeze bunt we have an out to give and you cant trust Joc to get a hit just because he homered.

He was overrated. He was a ball hog. He owed half his championships to Shaq, and half to a great team during a weak point in the NBA. Whenever the Lakers sucked(which was often), Kobe would cry like a little girl even though he was the reason they sucked. That year when he shot over 30 times a game and caused the Lakers to suck because of it was ridiculous. He really wasn't efficient enough as a scorer to be shooting that much. Lebron, Durant, and Curry, now I would love to see them shoot over 30 times a game. At least they are efficient like crazy. It was even more ridiulous when od man Kobe was shooting close to 30 times a game while shooting way below 40% from the field. But lets face it, shooting bad percenatges wa eactly what Kobe did. Seriously, how many times did he evr shoot above 45% from the field? How about over 46%? Even when he had those amazing teams around him, he could not shoot a good percentage. Kobe is one of the most overrated players in the history of the game. Not even close to being as good as MJ, Magic, Bird, or any of the top guys from the past. The convo should be MJ and Lbron, not MJ and Kobe. Heck, MJ and Curry is a better comparison than MJ and Kobe. Just cause Kobe got lucky and won a bunch of championships(despite Kobe hurtig all those teams with his inefficient play) does not mean he deserves to be in the convo. If you want to compare Kobe with MJ just cause all his lucky championships, then you need to compare MJ and Derek Fisher too, or MJ and Robert Horry. Kobe is a joke and will be remembered for nothing other than being a POC rapist","message_id":"a0bd0fb4-fe57-4489-a168-bc465ca809f5","context_id":"abfa168f-d348-3fd5-b3b7-c898e8cbd872","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Angry spit talking troll","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_AS_ad.jpg","author_guid":"XP4CZK4QIUU4DC3BF6SZ3XV3NY","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-5a588cc1-29be-398d-a8c3-a5af532c2226_a-abfa168f-d348-3fd5-b3b7-c898e8cbd872","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/nick-young-compares-playing-warriors-5l88dju","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"NBC Sports BayArea","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nick-young-compares-playing-warriors-153006107.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/csnbayarea.com\/cc02415c3ffec74a44235f08dc62efd4","title":"Nick Young compares playing with Warriors vs playing with Kobe","summary":"Nick Young and Kobe Bryant were teammates in Los Angeles for three seasons.

Good riddance, Darryl Sutter, too bad the franchise, Brown, and Kopitar had to sacrifice the last three years to Darryl Sutter's belligerent mismanagement.","message_id":"1b7de4a4-3416-435b-b829-2a3fe8bab1ba","context_id":"d58ecc0a-e307-39e6-95b4-3fa0426a5d99","upvotes":0,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"wes","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/d3144d5740f9f3735a88d890ebb4e7e1_192.png","author_guid":"V6EDE3YWFNW4LUFGTYS5QPGN2A","score":0.17032883649179,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-47a7cd08-606d-3c9c-9438-d3a89d649d86_a-d58ecc0a-e307-39e6-95b4-3fa0426a5d99","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/puck-daddy-countdown-galchenyuk-oilers-offense-goalie-controversies-198bpo1","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Puck Daddy","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/puck-daddy-countdown-galchenyuk-oilers-offense-goalie-controversies-173253480.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/d346338163e6465f80c54025ff594655","title":"Puck Daddy Countdown: Galchenyuk, Oilers offense and goalie controversies","summary":"The Oilers need to put Ryan Nugent-Hopkins in a better position to succeed.

I was lucky enough to be raised in the early 90s outside of Dallas, Texas.  I grew up a huge Cowboys fan.  As an Army veteran, I will not support a business that openly disrespects my service and sacrifices (as well as those who served with me.)

The notion that we criminalize one and advertise the other, on every sports program imaginable, defies logic and reason.  The idea that imbeciles like Jefferson Beauregard Sessions still think marijuana is on par with heroin demonstrate their lack of understanding and their political prejudices.

The expectations were WAY too high. And then after those expectations, people put way too much stock in that Florida win. Look, Michigan is a decent team. They are not great, but they are pretty good. I agree with the 8-4 predictions. They may pull off one upset and be 9-3 (they will not get both). They have such a young defense but everyone expects Harbaugh to waive a magic wand and all the sudden make them the best. Make no mistake, they are good, but they are young. Wait a season or two (under this young defense) THEN raise the expectations. They are still recruiting well, so the talent will come. It just has to develop. Even under Hoke and Rodriguez many UofM teams were ranked in the top 25 and in some cases top 10 to start the season.  They usually then fell way out of the rankings. Why don\u2019t we wait for a Michigan team to actually prove they are a top 10 team before actually putting them there for a change?","message_id":"4a1a1fae-0dd9-492b-b0b3-c94c95721e09","context_id":"4ff72aec-d620-32da-a2ca-9d5e3725aa2d","upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":4,"author_name":"Michael P","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_MP_jl.jpg","author_guid":"2YSCPEYRGQS6VKFFCRLWI6LJEE","score":0.64841045908534,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-8c84116f-8f84-3973-8f8f-f5ab0e480cfb_a-4ff72aec-d620-32da-a2ca-9d5e3725aa2d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/roundtable-assess-michigan-now-going-forward-2c9yd5v","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Dr. Saturday","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/roundtable-assess-michigan-now-going-forward-125834118.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/8a81ac7a45c5d9c75e926a7220deaa29","title":"Roundtable: How should we assess Michigan now and going forward?","summary":"Are the Wolverines really having an underachieving season or is UM's 5-2 record about what it should be?","published_at":1508936314,"content_id":"4ff72aec-d620-32da-a2ca-9d5e3725aa2d","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/roundtable-assess-michigan-now-going-forward-125834118.html","content_published_at":1508936314,"content_relative_time":27,"vibe_name":"Sports","vibe_id":"5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104"},"created_at":1508947371,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":false},{"text":"Duh!!!

Life changed and the work hard, play hard finally caught up to me. I have been on hydro's 7.5 for about 9 years. I adhere to what the  script  says. Now I get treated as a addict. MJ does more for me than pain killers. My body is addicted to pain killers, but mentally I am not. I would rather use something that has been around thousands of years as a remedy, than some one who cooked up chemicals that do work but are highly addictive and now the Gov if they had their way would like to make both harder to attain. If you are in pain 24hrs a day for so many years, you really  get to a point where you don't care. There have been times in my life where I had a episode that the pain was so bad that offered I would have shot heroin or morphine I didn't care, and I made a promise to myself I would never use a needle on myself. I have kept that promise for over 50 yrs, but like I said there has been times, pain can really screw with your mind. I would have a natural drug that won't kill you, and doesn't have bad side affects. And people I have quit things in my life, and MJ was the no big deal, compared to cigs which I have tried a number of times is hell. Quitting a anti depressants is no joy ride. MJ is only addictive if you think it is, but there is no huge side affects. I have been given drugs that said a side affect were what I was taking to get rid of. And my problem is I have a high tolerance. I have seen people take the lowest of hydros and they act drunk. All hyro's do for me is make my pain tolerable which is ok.

And this is coming from an OSU fan.","message_id":"e0646e27-b57b-4827-9716-7add94a54aec","context_id":"4ff72aec-d620-32da-a2ca-9d5e3725aa2d","upvotes":17,"downvotes":15,"reports":0,"replies":7,"author_name":"Chris C","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/89534e1b453182406d7ca67372678f0f_192.jpg","author_guid":"G5PIV2VUDXPEVREOKYUD7XVCSI","score":0.5639375145341,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-8c84116f-8f84-3973-8f8f-f5ab0e480cfb_a-4ff72aec-d620-32da-a2ca-9d5e3725aa2d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/roundtable-assess-michigan-now-going-forward-2c9yd5v","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Dr. Saturday","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/roundtable-assess-michigan-now-going-forward-125834118.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/8a81ac7a45c5d9c75e926a7220deaa29","title":"Roundtable: How should we assess Michigan now and going forward?","summary":"Are the Wolverines really having an underachieving season or is UM's 5-2 record about what it should be?","published_at":1508936314,"content_id":"4ff72aec-d620-32da-a2ca-9d5e3725aa2d","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/roundtable-assess-michigan-now-going-forward-125834118.html","content_published_at":1508936314,"content_relative_time":27,"vibe_name":"Sports","vibe_id":"5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104"},"created_at":1508941116,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":false},{"text":"Why the political comment?

He is under team control for this and next season and has zero leverage to tell the team anything.  Offensive lineman Ramon Foster has also made comments that indicate that Bryant is feeling the heat from his girlfriend and possibly family to try to cash out and try to get a big deal. They believe if he gets cut or traded he can latch onto another team and become a superstar with a massive contract. What Bryant needs to realize is that with his suspension history and inconsistent play he needs to show up to work, shut up, and prove on the field he can be counted on before the big money comes his way.  He is getting very bad advice from those who clearly have an agenda and monetary stake on his career in the NFL.  Quite frankly if he doesn't wise up the Steelers should let him rot on the bench for the next few seasons until his deal is up or possibly look for into a trade that can bring something of value in return to help them win now.  Pryor has been feeling some heat in Washington and has been benched.  He only has a 1 year deal and Washington may be willing to make a deal.  If Washington if willing to listen I trade like that at least should be considered.  Bottom line Bryant need to cut off the leeches in his life, lay off the weed, and come to work ready to put in 100% before he starts flapping his gums.","message_id":"b56af230-33e8-4552-af22-7da872334355","context_id":"9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"PGH247","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_P_ad.jpg","author_guid":"UIL72UCHXIRG2DGSO2S5H6CQX4","score":0.52753718344348,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-3a021159-a7f2-3e69-be3f-384dd79a02dd_a-9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-3a021159-a7f2-3e69-be3f-384dd79a02dd_a-9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","author":"third_watch","provider":"Sporting News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/hints-suggest-martavis-bryant-apos-191524411.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/article.sportingnews.com\/62e8856d0cf364e24e23ab3c533fa231","title":"Hints suggest Martavis Bryant's problem is closer to home than Steelers","summary":"Martavis Bryant appears to be in a difficult situation, and his dissatisfaction in Pittsburgh might have little to do with the Steelers.","published_at":1508951067,"content_id":"9da661a5-3878-30e7-8e3a-0e6f7f3a8236","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/hints-suggest-martavis-bryant-apos-191524411.html","content_published_at":1508874437,"content_relative_time":44,"vibe_name":"Sports","vibe_id":"5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104"},"created_at":1508937586,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":false},{"text":"Jonathan Ericsson for anybody on the Oilers . . . please.","message_id":"f71965d9-f15e-45cf-966c-9ebb39602ec3","context_id":"d58ecc0a-e307-39e6-95b4-3fa0426a5d99","upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Mark W","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/afdced14644a6f53d82b74dd46057c95_192.jpeg","author_guid":"3AHKOWYWERLWTWCQJPSTI6GHE4","score":0.52753718344348,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-47a7cd08-606d-3c9c-9438-d3a89d649d86_a-d58ecc0a-e307-39e6-95b4-3fa0426a5d99","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/puck-daddy-countdown-galchenyuk-oilers-offense-goalie-controversies-198bpo1","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Puck Daddy","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/puck-daddy-countdown-galchenyuk-oilers-offense-goalie-controversies-173253480.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/d346338163e6465f80c54025ff594655","title":"Puck Daddy Countdown: Galchenyuk, Oilers offense and goalie controversies","summary":"The Oilers need to put Ryan Nugent-Hopkins in a better position to succeed.

It's obvious he still has the mental tools to figure out a defense. Before he hurt his back he was at his best. I was there at his last great moment when he drove the Cowboys without a time-out down the field to beat the Giants opening night 2015. And most of us saw he still had the skills in his last action when he relieved Dak and took the team downfield for a TD against the Eagles last year. I think he enjoys his new gig because he sees the game from a different perspective. But I know he's burning to back in the game. I think a job as an offensive coach would fit him nicely. In fact I would love to see Tony come back to Dallas as maybe assistant and eventually an OC for the Cowboys.","message_id":"303b83cd-dadc-4f5d-8294-a73a3456526a","context_id":"10dcbe2e-6675-3b57-ab93-7ee1e6767fab","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"j","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/2c9bf3314837c282a77dfec936aaba7a_192.png","author_guid":"VS2BBSMKY6KMMLCYC5L2TXHR2I","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-c3bbaf34-062e-3d28-ac72-f7718449b54e_a-10dcbe2e-6675-3b57-ab93-7ee1e6767fab","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/no-folks-tony-romo-doesnt-want-come-back-play-4a2ov8f","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/no-folks-tony-romo-doesnt-want-come-back-play-142734094.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/13e633ba2cc4c662088847496f5c3f6a","title":"No folks, Tony Romo doesn't want to come back and play again","summary":"Once again, Tony Romo explained why he's not leaving CBS to play in the NFL again.","published_at":1508941671,"content_id":"10dcbe2e-6675-3b57-ab93-7ee1e6767fab","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/no-folks-tony-romo-doesnt-want-come-back-play-142734094.html","content_published_at":1508941654,"content_relative_time":26,"vibe_name":"Sports","vibe_id":"5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104"},"created_at":1508980393,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":false},{"text":"Tons of talent, but the immaturity factor weighs on Bryant big time.
