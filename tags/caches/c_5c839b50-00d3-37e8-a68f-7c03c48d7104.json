They were able to overcome playing with an injured 2x MVP Steph Curry.  It wasn't until after game 4 that LeBaby went on national tv to publicly cry about Draymond Green that got the league to UPGRADE his \"common foul\" to \"flagrant foul.\"  The league really wanted to extend the Finals, not wanting it over in 5 games.  What they didn't count on was untimely injuries then happening to both Iguodala and Bogut, two of the Warriors top-4 defense players at that time.  It was too much to over come, Cleveland got their perfect storm. It took ALL of that to barely beat the Dubs by 4 points in the 7th game.  I rest my case.

To rule runners safe when incorrectly called out or vice versa, which is what happened on the pick off at first. And they \"probably\" got it right, no not probably, they did get it right. Don't tell me if the situation was reversed and it was a Cub getting picked off, Nats fans wouldn't be praising video replay. If you want the human error element back then dump replay and go back to the way it was for over 100 years. But you can't have it both ways. Bad enough Jerry Lane's strike zone was completely inconsistent. There's something to talk about.","message_id":"d59c7877-ed4e-4285-8788-7d628f1dd78b","context_id":"42f20841-9c07-383e-8924-5a23a1d454ad","upvotes":54,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":7,"author_name":"Joe","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"PGDKW6NVZGKJXVKDUH33ACFS5Q","score":0.92773266223109,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-86aad10a-8ad5-3294-9e69-2ce448187845_a-42f20841-9c07-383e-8924-5a23a1d454ad","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/mlbs-video-replay-totally-screwed-washington-nationals-3je5e1x","author":"nanook","provider":"Big League Stew","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/mlbs-video-replay-totally-screwed-washington-nationals-085152023.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/c9feb5482cde372544a11ff5200728c1","title":"How MLB's video replay totally screwed the Washington Nationals","summary":"Jose Lobaton pick-off play proves that, in this instance, MLB video replay has lost the spirit of the game","published_at":1507884712,"content_id":"42f20841-9c07-383e-8924-5a23a1d454ad","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/mlbs-video-replay-totally-screwed-washington-nationals-085152023.html","content_published_at":1507884712,"content_relative_time":14,"vibe_name":"Sports","vibe_id":"5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104"},"created_at":1507899948,"comment_relative_time":10,"bot":false},{"text":"As not a major Trump fan this article is still B*ll #$%$..............they were politicizing this before Trump got anywhere near it.

As far as replay goes I was initially against it, but have warmed up to it.  Replay forces these guys to be more fundamental with slides, tags, foot-on-base, etc.  Just because the ball beats the runner, the defender still needs to apply the proper tag.  In last nights case, the runner should slide and stay on the base.  That's the rule.  If your not on the base and you are tagged, you're out.  As far as holding the tag in case the runner pops off the bag, infielders have been doing this for years, way before replay.  The so called \"neighborhood\" play? That \"neighborhood\" thing used to award a bad throw from a middle infielder.  Again, replay has reigned in the fact that you must have your foot on the bag when you make a force play.  I do agree that Lobaton should not put himself in a position to be pick off in that situation.  Very bad mistake on his part.\n\nNo one is manipulating the system.  You're either on the base or you're not.  Keep it simple.
