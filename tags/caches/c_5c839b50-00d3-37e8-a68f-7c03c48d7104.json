Tittle was the Giants QB and things didn't work out for him that day but he was a great QB for the Giants and others. That was when I started to root for the Giants. When he retired after the 1964 season he was the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns, attempts, completions, and games played. His 36 TD passes in one year was the record till broken by Dan Marino. Great QB, one of the best ever.

You simply can't outlaw that.  But that's not what Ditka is talking about.  He is talking about institutionalized injustice.  Our country's policies addressed all these things in the 60s.  These laws were made primarily by whites (Congress) but were for the benefit of blacks and other minorities.  All the laws, state, federal and local do all they can to prevent institutionalized injustice.  But what most of these protesters want is social change.   They want to be treated better by the individuals they meet from day to day.   The amazing irony of this whole situation is that by protesting in this manner, all they will accomplish is for their race as a whole to be treated worse.  Seriously, how do they expect the average white person to feel when they see a huge crowd of blacks at a BLM demonstration shouting, \"Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon\" ?   Have they ever stopped to think about whether these type of protests will hurt their cause more than it could possibly help it?  If they really wanted to be treated better, the smart thing to do would be to stop these protests, because all they do is create more hatred, and on both sides at that.  People will always generalize.  If some white person sees a violent BLM protest going on, do the people protesting really think those observers are likely to treat them better in the future?  (And not just them, but all the others of their race as well.)  The answer is obvious, but there are a lot of stupid people who cannot comprehend the simplest of concepts.  You want to be treated better, as a whole?  Then simply behave better, as a whole.  When the crime statistics even off between races, I guarantee you will see race relations improved 1000%.

Mike Matheny who insisted LIFE LONG Cardinal Matt Carpenter hit lead off even though he was hitting .239 while newcomers like Kolten Wong, Magnarius Sierra, and Tommy Pham were all hitting better than .300.\n\n02. John Mozeliak who keeps giving washed up pitchers like Brett Cecil big contract with the wishful thinking they might regain their form, but they never do because miracle pitching coach Dave Duncan is long gone. And it was Mozeliak who gave a STEROID ABUSER, Johnny Peralta, who no other team would touch $54,000,000 for 4 years.\n\n03. The VETERANS in the bull pen. Rosenthal is no longer effective. The 35 year old Korean (Oh) was not effective this year as well. And they gave up on Kevin Seigcrist.\n\n04. VETERANS Carpenter, Piscotty, and Grichuk who all hit  ~ .240 for the season.\n\n05. A young and therefore erratic starting rotation who rarely pitch more than 5 or 6 innings placing undo pressure on an overworked and below average bull pen.\n\n06. Adam Wainright who made $22,000,000+ last year but is no longer an ACE.  However, it must be noted that his decline is due to aging which is to be expected.","id":"3abca937-1215-41a3-b515-679097c24535","context_id":"ab3bde79-bb1a-3ad5-a902-fabfa2a218b4","upvotes":11,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Nathan","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_N_ald.jpg","score":0.81254087307037,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-e71315a8-7b0e-31fa-a02a-91d8cb8ca22d_a-ab3bde79-bb1a-3ad5-a902-fabfa2a218b4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/cardinals-veterans-reportedly-blame-new-players-season-failures-5j7f9ff","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Big League Stew","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/cardinals-veterans-reportedly-blame-new-players-season-failures-152344258.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/7ad81668b624fb3600c4c0c64c14b6a2","title":"Cardinals failures blamed on new players not following 'The Cardinal Way'","summary":"The Cardinals missed the playoffs again, and a few players know who's to blame: anyone who didn't follow \"The Cardinal Way.\"","published_at":1507562624,"content_id":"ab3bde79-bb1a-3ad5-a902-fabfa2a218b4","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/cardinals-veterans-reportedly-blame-new-players-season-failures-152344258.html","content_published_at":1507562624,"content_relative_time":31,"vibe_name":"Sports"},"created_at":1507568170,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":false},{"text":"What exactly is the \"Cardinal Way\"?","id":"7953faea-595c-4749-a2d6-39ef9aaa848d","context_id":"ab3bde79-bb1a-3ad5-a902-fabfa2a218b4","upvotes":11,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"Nathan","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_N_ald.jpg","score":0.81254087307037,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-e71315a8-7b0e-31fa-a02a-91d8cb8ca22d_a-ab3bde79-bb1a-3ad5-a902-fabfa2a218b4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/cardinals-veterans-reportedly-blame-new-players-season-failures-5j7f9ff","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Big League Stew","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/cardinals-veterans-reportedly-blame-new-players-season-failures-152344258.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/7ad81668b624fb3600c4c0c64c14b6a2","title":"Cardinals failures blamed on new players not following 'The Cardinal Way'","summary":"The Cardinals missed the playoffs again, and a few players know who's to blame: anyone who didn't follow \"The Cardinal Way.\"","published_at":1507562624,"content_id":"ab3bde79-bb1a-3ad5-a902-fabfa2a218b4","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/cardinals-veterans-reportedly-blame-new-players-season-failures-152344258.html","content_published_at":1507562624,"content_relative_time":31,"vibe_name":"Sports"},"created_at":1507568170,"comment_relative_time":30,"bot":false},{"text":"Why would ANYONE give this jerk another chance?
