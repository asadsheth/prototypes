The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way.

DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone?

In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

(More accolades from friends, schoolmates, and society from playing football, basketball, baseball.) HOWEVER... the thing one forgets is that many more primary school kids play SOCCER over those other sports. The problem is WE LOSE THEM as they get older! The pool to choose exceptional athletes from... shrinks. Why is this?? (Weigh-in below.) Thus I concur with the above article that it is the YOUTH DEVELOPMENT system that is broken, it needs to 1) Identify, 2) Inspire, 3) Coach well, and 4) Pay the fees for... the future high-calibre players. You can hope MLS helps, but look at how many foreign players are on the rosters! And yes, the best players play in Europe, no doubt. The thing MLS has to offer is the FUN and inspiration of supporting a pro team, and, even more importantly, the ACADEMIES they run for teenagers showing promise. Paul Ariola is a GREAT example of what\/who we should have MORE of.

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

I will tell you how it is broken and it is the same issue with top soccer levels. It is through a corrupt system. First, it comes down to money. Players are put on teams based on how much money that player brings in. Yes, parental politics, friends of BoD, friends of sponsors, etc. The list goes on. You will see this as early as age 8 for competitive soccer. Second, There is no independent evaluation of soccer talent. The corrupt club evaluates and determines where a player gets to play. It has nothing to do with talent. The club states emphatically before tryouts that the players will be evaluated and rated 1-N. The top X will be on the top team, then the next group of X go on the second team, and so on. What happens when the top X are really #13, #24, #28, #54, etc. and you quickly recognize that these are all kids of sponsors for the club, friends of people on the BoD, large donors to the club? As in our club, the team sucks and they have to explain to Teams #3, #4, and #5 that have outplayed them, beaten them badly, have them completely out talented that it is because they are teaching a different set of skills, field tactics, and strategy. One parent was severely reprimanded at the parent meeting when they asked if the strategy was to suck. Rightfully so to ask in the meeting because his daughter was being recruited for college and the club kept trying to push the recruiter to the \"top\" team goalkeeper. The HC of that Top 25 college told the club that they no longer evaluate player talent from the club's top team because they have access to all of the statistics of the players, who they played, how they performed, and the records against a somewhat standardized team ranking system. Wen you have Team A with GF at 12, GA at 32, and a record of 1-8-1 with the \"best\" players and Team C (this is the one with the 3rd set of ranked players #37 - #54) with a record of 7-2-1 against the same exact teams with GF at 35, GA at 8. How do you explain that logic? The club can't and they are paying the price at the college recruiting level.","id":"1cce9187-6880-435c-8be7-c3609628fc24","context_id":"4338547e-953b-33a2-bbe4-014ce45763fa","upvotes":17,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"dick","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ad.jpg","score":0.8376695262521,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-8a4d99b0-26d4-3567-9fa0-6817726c81a2_a-4338547e-953b-33a2-bbe4-014ce45763fa","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-8a4d99b0-26d4-3567-9fa0-6817726c81a2_a-4338547e-953b-33a2-bbe4-014ce45763fa","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Yahoo Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/usmnt-doesnt-need-better-athletes-win-world-cup-060526124.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/bd80cb464bf3fe5d56f0471d122cf551","title":"Why the U.S. team doesn't need 'better athletes' to win a World Cup","summary":"The U.S. doesn't need the next Russell Westbrook to play soccer instead of basketball.

His line up was madness  and doomed for failure.  Three forwards and defensively weak Nagbe in a match in another country in which a tie was all that was needed?  You have to be kidding me. Twellman warned everyone at the end of the Panama match how exposed Bradley was due to the fact that Nabe wouldn't play defense.  The T&T coach (like everyone else) simply listened to Twellman. A high school soccer\/football coach could see the problem before the first goal was scored. Just as upsetting, once it was clear that T&T was counter attacking on the left in the vacated space by Nagbe, why didn't Arena make an adjustment? It should never have gotten to the last game but the T&T match showed how clueless the USA coaching staff was. Arena was out coached today. For someone of his experience, it was shocking. Finally, where was his assistant coaches? Couldn't they see what was going on. Every time Nagbe went forward, he moved towards his right thereby clogging up the middle of the field as well as creating a massive hole on the left side.","id":"9df9b5c6-fb16-4cc6-b5a7-6c70e91b1c13","context_id":"c34ea7a6-c7db-307d-8ca4-19bee1836110","upvotes":17,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Tegegne Mulugeta","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_TM_nl.jpg","score":0.8376695262521,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-081b0746-5055-383c-8c65-6bb0efe92868_a-c34ea7a6-c7db-307d-8ca4-19bee1836110","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-081b0746-5055-383c-8c65-6bb0efe92868_a-c34ea7a6-c7db-307d-8ca4-19bee1836110","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"FC Yahoo","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/five-main-culprits-u-s-shocking-world-cup-failure-050218707.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/4ac0014ced99d67541742ce7ced1b44c","title":"Five main culprits for Team USA's shocking World Cup failure","summary":"The United States men's national team missed the World Cup.

They must do more to help a broader base of talents get a chance, ie said low income families.  That is how many countries do it and in fact soccer is a way out of poverty for some so they are fighting for their meals.  I would rather see a team of blood thirsty, hungry players who don't fear anyone because they need their meals going up against Brazil, Mexico, and others, than a bunch of privileged players who have been pampered all their lives but never understood what it is like to have that hunger to play.  That and we need a leader who will install pride in soccer at all levels.  I played soccer before on 3 levels and got to mix it up with some great worldly players and let me tell you the way it is.  They see USA as a basketball country that is up and coming in soccer but that has been since 1994, 23 years now without elevating to the next level.  They also do not respect us as a country team because they know that we will either be in awe of them or we simply cannot match their talent.  Except when we play other English language countries where pride pushes us forward, this has some truth to it.  Meanwhile, those people I trained with and played with changed my thinking by allowing me to really respect them and take their hunger for the game seriously.  These people will break legs to win while we tend to plod along.  As a player, I have learned to add that sense of urgency and also take pride in the game, thanks to Brazilians, Africans, Europeans, and Asian players.  When we develop this hunger and pride, plus install a system at the roots and get leaders who will push us, we will succeed.","id":"8cef5fc5-e7a2-47bb-8a3b-6fce450efd73","context_id":"c34ea7a6-c7db-307d-8ca4-19bee1836110","upvotes":19,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Tegegne Mulugeta","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_TM_nl.jpg","score":0.8260427017704,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-081b0746-5055-383c-8c65-6bb0efe92868_a-c34ea7a6-c7db-307d-8ca4-19bee1836110","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-081b0746-5055-383c-8c65-6bb0efe92868_a-c34ea7a6-c7db-307d-8ca4-19bee1836110","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"FC Yahoo","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/five-main-culprits-u-s-shocking-world-cup-failure-050218707.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/4ac0014ced99d67541742ce7ced1b44c","title":"Five main culprits for Team USA's shocking World Cup failure","summary":"The United States men's national team missed the World Cup.

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

There is a reason why so many of the world soccer championships are dominated by teams with players whose names end in vowels.(with the exception of Germany). I would suggest that the coaching staff watch the movie 'Miracle on Ice' about 50 times.If you want to win on the world stage, you must play like the teams that win on the world stage. They must abandon their '1950's' style and tactics (kick it and chase it) and adapt to a style of game that involves individual skills, touch, and understanding of the game (sorry Jose - that means you will likely have to sit down).

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

Social media has evolved enough that each and every player can express their personal views on their own time.  Not only that, but the overflow into college sports, high school sports, and even kids sports is leaving a bad precedence for future generations.  When you put the uniform on go play the game.  After you take the uniform off go about your personal business.","id":"ca6f9253-07ee-4952-9c72-2956bc2b3a68","context_id":"f10986e9-e6d3-3f89-bff1-3240a8a6bbd4","upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Evolt","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_E_kl_2_6-16.jpg","score":0.64841045908534,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-b1dd4a86-d570-3e2d-bc5d-97697e8a6a71_a-f10986e9-e6d3-3f89-bff1-3240a8a6bbd4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/roger-goodell-memo-means-national-sk269ab","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Sports Illustrated","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/roger-goodell-memo-means-national-044220515.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/video\/video.sportsillustrated.time.com\/2718fe6177278b34f63a7213f67bce12","title":"What Roger Goodell\u2019s Memo Means for the National Anthem Protests Going Forward","summary":"Things you need to know this morning about where the issue of players standing for the national anthem lies, and what the league might do to force players to do so: 1. The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

It's really tough to have a ego much bigger than you are. The players union fought for players to become free agents and move on to where ever they wanted. A GM's job is to put the best team on a floor for it's fans. The fans are king in sports, not the players, but players with their paycheck and elitist mentality have become more and more to the thinking that they run the show. IT demanded being paid a max contract for a one way player, that is injured and history tells us may not ever be the same. He may come back and be the best PG in the NBA, he may be a one hit wonder, but these are the things a GM has to judge. IT came out of no where to have a couple great offensive seasons, but his game was never well rounded, and PG's who have the ball in their hands the greatest percentage of the time have that advantage.  Pros learn that it's part of the business, there have been players that have been traded away and come back to play well for the same team. IT has been a typical celebrity that let his ego get the best of him, confidence is one thing but ego can make you out to be so self centered you can't get out of your own way. Humble is key to being great and staying that way.

That's why there is a World's Cup competition. In the USA almost every kid plays soccer (or try to), but the kids are not trained properly. I tried to coach a 10-12 year old soccer team, but I stopped almost right away, because the kids don't have the mentality needed for becoming an athlete (of any sport). The kids are told by the parents to have fun, not to really learn the sport, to become the best at it. That is the problem in the USA soccer.In Europe a soccer player starts at age 7 , or earlier. There are scouts from major teams monitoring the kids' clubs. If a player shows talent, he gets picked by a professional team and trained by a professional coach, already at age 7.By the time the player is 12, he shows his true potential. He is going to become a professional player or he will stay with lower teams for life.The good player, at age 16, will be introduced into the main professional team and that's when he start his professional career.In the USA the kids are coached by unqualified coaches that, in most cases, have never played soccer or never played soccer at a professional level. How can these coaches teach soccer to the kids?A professional USA team picks players from colleges. The players are already 21-22 coached by people that don't know the game and they are too old!!! Soccer is not baseball or other traditionally played American sports that are coached by professional coaches from High School to College and the players emerge when are in College. Soccer is content and serious training since age #$%$ not a \"fun\" game. It's serious game where we play to win!! Losing the game is not acceptable!!

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem.

I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

Roger Goodell\u2019s Memo Means for the National Anthem Protests Going Forward","summary":"Things you need to know this morning about where the issue of players standing for the national anthem lies, and what the league might do to force players to do so: 1. The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties.

Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock.

Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way.

I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts.

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

Maybe scouts are looking in the wrong places. More money needs to go into building teams from the ground up, which means investing heavy in farm systems and creating leagues accessible to children regardless of race, age, religion and economic status. The sport will not flourish and the U.S. will not have a winning soccer team if this is not met. In Texas where I live, only those children who belong to families of wealth and privilege thrive in this sport. I could take a rag tag team of kids from the ghettos and barrios and crush any team wealthy U.S. citizens can create. What the U.S. mens team lack is hunger. This U.S. team is too focused on entitlement, money and fame. Politics does not help any team sport period. If the U.S. wants to win a World Cup, they need to look at Brazil, Argentina and Germany and study them. Entitled thinking players need to be checked. The U.S. soccer team and its front office needs to be restructured from the top down, they all must go. Otherwise they will continue to be the poster child for the word \"insane\". There is a trove and unlimited untapped potential in this nations southern region from the east to the west coast, particularly in the warmest regions of the country. It is these players who need to be tapped. It's these young men who I would develop into an unstoppable force in the soccer world.","id":"1ac7ae0d-206e-439b-be91-d744f086de18","context_id":"7b281c3d-c547-3f88-8d36-61f37db762b2","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"The Doc","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_T_ald_4_6-16.jpg","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-53b7b082-913e-3c1b-854b-f9f1881f24ca_a-7b281c3d-c547-3f88-8d36-61f37db762b2","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/u-s-soccer-go-10-immediate-aftershocks-world-cup-failure-1f81k8u","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"FC Yahoo","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/u-s-soccer-go-10-immediate-aftershocks-world-cup-failure-102333859.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/4ac0014ced99d67541742ce7ced1b44c","title":"Where does U.S. Soccer go from here? 10 immediate aftershocks of World Cup failure","summary":"Arena is gone.

Watched the 64 championship game with my father. The last 18 years have been crazy bad. All the front office changing, all the coaching changes, all the draft busts, all the players that they passed on in the draft over the years paints a pretty dismal picture. I do like Jackson, and Kizer may have a future and maybe not. Hogan has definetly looked the better of the 2. What I look at right  now is the bad OL play. We have no running game and the pass protection isn't great. With all the players they brought in for the OL, they are doing very well as a unit. The secondary isn't to great either. Look back at all the number one receivers who have had their way with them. I thought they were going to be better this year and they may be, but right now they are brutal to watch. Turnovers, stupid penalties, poor kicking game, recievers who can't catch the ball, make for a game that's tough to watch. I don't know what to think anymore. You would think that the law of averages would catch up with them at sometime but I just don't know.","id":"d403277a-630d-49da-9cea-7e0390335ff6","context_id":"537535c5-8299-395a-9a7e-8102d5548d71","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Joe-ski","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-318f359a-b60c-3e31-8b45-c1fceee703f7_a-537535c5-8299-395a-9a7e-8102d5548d71","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/browns-announce-kevin-hogan-will-start-deshone-kizer-backup-685w3sa","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/browns-announce-kevin-hogan-will-start-deshone-kizer-backup-130259776.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/300ee58b4bce0c2a273129fe7d3a4002","title":"Browns announce Kevin Hogan will start, DeShone Kizer to be backup","summary":"At 0-5 and with a floundering rookie quarterback, the Browns are making a change.","published_at":1507726979,"content_id":"537535c5-8299-395a-9a7e-8102d5548d71","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/browns-announce-kevin-hogan-will-start-deshone-kizer-backup-130259776.html","content_published_at":1507726979,"content_relative_time":5,"vibe_name":"Sports"},"created_at":1507733745,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":false},{"text":"its a crying shame that the NFL has to rewrite the rule book to make people not kneel and disrespect the country that they say they love. you learned it in elementary school how to respect your country but yet you do it anyway for something you should be taking your protest in a different way. keep it up and the people who buys tickets and team stuff quits buying your income will change. will that get your attention","id":"ad82cca0-8b5a-4592-9e5e-b7142d4b142d","context_id":"f10986e9-e6d3-3f89-bff1-3240a8a6bbd4","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Evolt","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_E_kl_2_6-16.jpg","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-b1dd4a86-d570-3e2d-bc5d-97697e8a6a71_a-f10986e9-e6d3-3f89-bff1-3240a8a6bbd4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/roger-goodell-memo-means-national-sk269ab","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Sports Illustrated","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/roger-goodell-memo-means-national-044220515.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/video\/video.sportsillustrated.time.com\/2718fe6177278b34f63a7213f67bce12","title":"What Roger Goodell\u2019s Memo Means for the National Anthem Protests Going Forward","summary":"Things you need to know this morning about where the issue of players standing for the national anthem lies, and what the league might do to force players to do so: 1. The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

The league currently has no proposal prepared to vote on next week at the NFL owners\u2019 meeting in New York that would mandate players to stand at attention for the national anthem. This could be semantics. But I was told on Tuesday that the NFL is focused on trying to build a bridge to the players so that leaders such as Malcolm Jenkins and Doug Baldwin\u2014and the NFL Players Association\u2014could feel good about partnering with the league on some community initiatives. 2. Roger Goodell did lay down the gauntlet on Tuesday, however. While Goodell was in Miami participating in a ride along with three Dolphins players and the North Miami Police Department and the Broward Country Sheriff\u2019s Department, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter broke the story of Goodell\u2019s memo to NFL ownership. It said, in part: \u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem \u2026 We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d Goodell said the league \u201cwanted to move past this controversy \u2026 together with our players.\u201d The tenor of the memo was clear: Although the league might feel the anthem controversy has been hijacked by the President and Vice President, we\u2019re not going to make progress on the issues the players care about by continuing to protest during the anthem. We\u2019ve got to stand for the anthem or risk alienating a huge swath of our fans. Now the question will be: Will the players buy that? 3. There is no question that the players can\u2019t simply take some money deal from the owners to do social justice work in exchange for agreeing to all stand for the anthem, because they\u2019d risk being labeled as sellouts to the protest cause. This will be the tricky part, navigating the endgame. The NFL has to find some way for the players to win. 4. The endgame? My gut feeling is the league will start by offering to devote a week or weeks\u2014the way the NFL does with cancer causes (\u201cCrucial Catch\u201d) or the military (\u201cSalute to Service\u201d)\u2014to fund and partner with players to highlight and sponsor work on civil rights causes in NFL communities. That could be promoting better police-community relations, or working on reduced sentencing and work-release employment programs. It is thought that the players have been pressing the league to spend multiple weeks on social work and civil rights projects this season, and the success or failure of this partnership will probably be decided by whether players feel the league is digging deep enough to make real change in communities.I have spoken to a couple of players in recent weeks, since this controversy started, who are skeptical of the NFL\u2019s efforts. One said the NFL\u2019s history of dehumanizing players and forcing them to do what owners want (the way Dallas owner Jerry Jones spoke about not allowing any protesting player to play for his team) reinforces the impression among players that if they don\u2019t get in line, the league will try to steamroll them. That, clearly, is an impression the NFL will have to fight\u2014that they\u2019re just playing nice now to get the players to do what they want.Another player, Baldwin, sounded introspective on Tuesday after the Goodell memo leaked. He wanted some time to consider his thoughts, then said he felt the NFL and its players shouldn\u2019t continue the fight that President Donald Trump started almost three weeks ago.\u201cAs an NFL community,\u201d Baldwin said, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we do not directly engage in the divisive rhetoric that is clearly being aimed at the NFL. It\u2019s also important that we understand that the original intent and motivation of the players\u2019 peaceful protest was to bring awareness to social issues that we see in our country. Although I know the divisive rhetoric is accomplishing its goal in our society, I do believe this is a unique opportunity for the NFL to galvanize our efforts collectively while re-humanizing the players and engaging in the true issues. I hope we can be a model for our society.\u201dBaldwin is one of the players the NFL wants to be part of the bridge building, and he seems amenable to try to be a part of a solution. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith,\u201d he said from his home in Seattle. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to lend myself to an optimistic view. I believe we can find a way to make a lot of lives better.\u201cThis has never been about disrespecting the flag. This has always been about trying to better society, and we hope we can work with the NFL to help do that. I think it\u2019s up to us to speak up for those who don\u2019t have voices to speak. Working to help those who need help, working to try to make society better, is both patriotic and honorable.\u201dRecently, I asked Baldwin about his passion for this issue\u2014about not just being an athlete who only plays and ignores the evening news. He sounded surprised at the question.\u201cHow can you not have a vested interest in the future of our society?\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI understand we all have our issues. We have issues in our locker room. We have issues in our society. But even though we have issues on our team, we come every week unified. We\u2019re a team. We work toward a collective goal. We put aside our egos for the greater good. That\u2019s what I want us to do in our communities now.\u201dIn the next week, Goodell\u2019s challenge will be to make players believe the league and the owners share Baldwin\u2019s attitude, or at least will contribute significantly to their causes. It\u2019s not going to be easy.Now for your email: ON PENCE\u2019S WALKOUTI enjoy reading your articles on MMQB. My comments about our VP walking out after the National Anthem was played are:- Yes he knew they 49ers would kneel;- Yes he knew his walking out would make news;- Yes, like the NFL players, he took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his protest of the protesters;- The media\u2019s focus on his walkout was their choice. The media could have, and probably should have, ignored him and focused on Peyton Manning\u2019s jersey retirement.- Our VP\u2019s behavior clearly indicated the serious issue of kneeling during the national anthem is not going away quietly; and,- The article mentioned the VP should have shown respect for Manning\u2019s jersey retirement by not walking out. Why? What is more important, showing respect for a retired football jersey or respect for our country and its flag? So you know my stance in all of this, I have no issue with the players\u2019 protesting in the way they see fit. Neither do I have any issue with those that oppose the players\u2019 manner of protesting. This is what makes our nation the greatest country to have ever existed. \u2014 Patrick Oates Interesting points, Patrick. My question for you: Do you seriously think if the Vice President of the United States attends a football game, with lots of attention surrounding his visit, to pay tribute to the greatest player in Indianapolis Colts\u2019 history, and walks out of the event before the halftime tribute is paid to Peyton Manning, because of the national anthem protests \u2026 that the nation\u2019s press should ignore it? Glad you\u2019re not my editor, or the editor of any publication that reports the news. PLEASE STICK TO SPORTSI don\u2019t understand. You complain that VP Mike Pence upstaged the Peyton Manning ceremony and as a result the Indianapolis Star website had five headlines talking about Pence leaving. If you were really concerned about Manning not getting his appropriate recognition, why didn\u2019t your article simply talk about Manning and the ceremony that celebrated him? Instead you spent paragraphs talking about the entourage that accompanies any American VP and other unnecessary details. You gave much more attention to Pence than to Peyton. Why is that? Are you just as partisan and political as Pence? Why can\u2019t ESPN and SI writers stick to sports, instead of politics? \u2014 David, California Three points, David: 1) I wrote 950 words on Manning\u2019s Saturday statue unveiling. Gave him quite a bit of his due. Was there another national columnist who wrote about Manning\u2019s statue unveiling? Did another national columnist or media person cover the event? Not that I saw. 2) Pence stole the attention from Manning\u2019s day on Sunday. When the Vice President walks out in protest at a football game, it\u2019s mega news, and it\u2019s going to overshadow everything else. 3) Pence is the one who chose to mix politics and sports at the highest level of the political and media food chain. Clearly this will never happen, because I\u2019m relatively inconsequential on the national scene, but I hope one day if I retire that someone I counted as a friend doesn\u2019t exploit my retirement for his own personal or business gain. That is precisely what Pence did to Manning. Last point on all of this: A prominent NFL executive wrote me a text Sunday night. The text said, in part, that this exec was appalled at the Vice President using Manning\u2019s ceremony for political reasons. This exec (I know, because we have discussed politics before) was a Trump voter. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU FOR THE COWBOYS Must be a Packers jinx. Why haven\u2019t my \u2019Boys learned the lesson not to leave time on the clock as it will come back and bite them, which did happen. The Cowboys had that game won aside for the stupid penalties. It was an amazing game on both sides. \u2014 Sylvia I feel strongly that the Cowboys messed up on the offensive play calls late. With 1:24 left in the fourth quarter, trailing by four points, Dallas had second-and-2 at the Green Bay 11-yard line. They chose to throw into the end zone. It was incomplete. Just not a smart call, because even if they score on the play, the Packers will have about 1:18 left, with one timeout, and Aaron Rodgers will simply need to drive 45 yards after the kickoff to tie the game with a field goal. The play there should have been to run Ezekiel Elliott up the gut and bleed the clock \u2026 or force the Packers to use their last timeout. Then, if Dallas didn\u2019t covert on the second-down run by Elliott, Dak Prescott would have two more plays to convert for a first down, and to bleed the clock. As important as scoring there, in my opinion, was taking significant time off the clock so that Aaron Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have enough time to win it. And after Prescott scored with a run on third down, Green Bay took over at its 25-yard line, down 31-28, with 1:13 and one timeout left. Who didn\u2019t think Rodgers was going to drive down for at least a field goal? So I fault Dallas\u2019s clock management in a big, big way. SOBER OCTOBERWhen I read your Beernerdness section of The MMQB this week, I answered your question about drinking too much as a YES. Some weeks I was wondering how you are able to write the great columns since you describe having quite a few different beers. Since you are going a month without beer, maybe you could spend one week talking about the variety of non-alcoholic beers that are on the market. You could even do your own taste testing and still complete your October challenge. It would be a great shout out to all of us who love beer but don\u2019t drink alcohol. \u2014 Chazz Steiner Thanks a lot, Chazz. That is a great idea. I will try a couple of them and get back to you with my reviews. In the meantime, I am going to give the Beernerdness section to fans\/readers the next three Mondays. DECLINING RATINGSWhen the NFL calculates their data on viewers, do they include the counts of how many folks are watching RedZone? Personally, as a lifelong Miami Dolphins fan in an Eagles market, I rarely watch live game broadcasts anymore. The local games generally don\u2019t interest me, and, if I watch RedZone, I get to watch snippets of the Dolphins games, often times live. Plus, the very draw of RedZone is that you get to see all of the scoring and interesting plays from around the league. Watching a whole game seems slow enough, but it gets slower when it\u2019s a game you are not emotionally invested in! \u2014 Diane, Doylestown, Pa. Diane, excellent point. In fact, the RedZone does nip away at the ratings. I\u2019ve been told about 900,000 or so viewers tune to RedZone for some or all of their Sunday viewing \u2026 but that clearly does not apply to the Monday night, Thursday night or Sunday night games, since those obviously have no competition from other games. The FOX and CBS Sunday day games would be affected, though. TRAVEL NOTEAs a Charlotte resident and aviation enthusiast, I have to take (slight) umbrage with your comment re: Indy being the only sports city that you can get to your gate in 29 minutes. The car ride from the Westin in Uptown Charlotte to Departures Road at the Charlotte airport in 15 minutes \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to get through pre-check and to your gate in the remaining 14 minutes. Just saying. \u2014 Matt DuBose My experience is that, from the time I leave my hotel room to the time I am at my gate at the airport, that Indianapolis is the fastest experience of any airport serving an NFL city. But I have done that Charlotte run the way you suggest, and I have never timed it. Where I think you\u2019d spend a few extra minutes is after getting through security \u2026 those four wings can contain some time-consuming walks. But I will hand it to you\u2014it would be close. STATUESIn regards to your call on more NFL teams to erect statues honoring their greatest players, you suggested that Denver should erect a statue of John Elway. While I agree that would be appropriate (probably even more so after his executive days are over), I\u2019m sure Elway would agree that Denver already has a statue honoring their most influential person over the past 30-plus years: Pat Bowlen. \u2014 Scott, Tucson You could be right, Scott. But my feeling is I\u2019ve never seen a franchise where the owner is more beloved than the best quarterback in franchise history. EARL THOMASI know Peter King was watching Dallas\/Green Bay, but I was surprised he didn\u2019t comment on Earl Thomas\u2019s play against the Rams. I guess I\u2019m a homer, but it was one of the great defensive plays I\u2019ve seen (and I grew up in Pittsburgh) by a free safety that plays on the level of Troy and Ed. \u2014 Howard Coleman I owe the Seahawks one after last weekend. I was so swamped that I didn\u2019t have the time to invest in a game that certainly deserved my attention. VETERAN QB TRADE?With the Jaguars suddenly relevant and so many teams with older QBs going nowhere, what do you think about the potential for a trade? Philip Rivers to the Jags? Eli Manning? Carson Palmer? I\u2019d include Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger, but neither the Saints nor the Steelers are probably ready to throw in the towel on 2017 yet. I know a mid-season trade, especially for a QB, would prove a steep (maybe impossible) learning curve. But Rivers could still be viable for the next 2-3 years. I think it could make a lot of sense. The Jags get a QB who isn\u2019t a liability (hopefully) and they can still draft someone in the next year or two to groom behind him. \u2014 Evan, Milwaukee I love the way you think, Evan. I hope the Jags make calls on Rivers and Manning before the Oct. 31 trade deadline. They could be a quarterback away from winning a game in January. Maybe two. Question? Comment? Story idea?

You'd be an idiot as a coach to NOT go with the hot hand. Whisenhunt foolishly did that with freaking Kurt Warner on the sidelines because he had Matt Leinart!? in there as the $$$ QB 1st round pick. We all know how that worked out and thankfully Whis got over himself and put the rightful guy in there, only to get to a Super Bowl. Now imagine if he had done that immediately the year before instead of \"trying out\" a new kid? Maybe another SB appearance. Here comes Hue trotting out the young rookie, which is totally fine, but he clearly hasn't proven himself whatsoever and is in over his head. Hogan was the better QB in training camp, keep him in. I hope this has nothing to do with race either that Hue would rather have had a black QB in there and chip on his shoulder about it. I hope Hogan does well, as a Steelers fan, I would be sick being a Browns fan every year, knowing you had some really great glory days with Kosar and Byner, and now 20+ years of schlock. How has this team NOT figured it out yet? All you need is a great O-line, a decent run game and the right QB. That will start any team off in the right direction. The Browns D is actually pretty good! I feel for all the Browns fans, I can't wait till I see their old school helmets in the Super Bowl one day, but it's a long way off.","id":"489304f2-3057-479d-8438-c339bb7e4284","context_id":"537535c5-8299-395a-9a7e-8102d5548d71","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Joe-ski","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-318f359a-b60c-3e31-8b45-c1fceee703f7_a-537535c5-8299-395a-9a7e-8102d5548d71","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/browns-announce-kevin-hogan-will-start-deshone-kizer-backup-685w3sa","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/browns-announce-kevin-hogan-will-start-deshone-kizer-backup-130259776.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/300ee58b4bce0c2a273129fe7d3a4002","title":"Browns announce Kevin Hogan will start, DeShone Kizer to be backup","summary":"At 0-5 and with a floundering rookie quarterback, the Browns are making a change.","published_at":1507726979,"content_id":"537535c5-8299-395a-9a7e-8102d5548d71","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/browns-announce-kevin-hogan-will-start-deshone-kizer-backup-130259776.html","content_published_at":1507726979,"content_relative_time":5,"vibe_name":"Sports"},"created_at":1507733745,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":false},{"text":"Shocking only because it appeared that allowing Kizer to play, no matter what, could get the coach another year in Cleveland.
