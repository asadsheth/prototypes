They said it was not political and that is exactly what it was. Cam Heywood's statement that they took a vote to protest what the President said did not coincide with the crafted Management and Team statement once they realized how badly this was taken by the Fans, so they erased it from the record and the internet as if it never happened. They closed ranks and covered up and never admitted they were wrong by offering an apology.

Hard to say about the other greats.","id":"7640d944-bc45-4d84-9d8f-f8784cc57f33","context_id":"543cbc3d-f6e3-361e-b0df-8d5c43b9eb11","upvotes":137,"downvotes":26,"reports":0,"replies":12,"author_name":"Consultofactus","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/d797c8a807efd282e3d0e4686bfc13d8_192.png","score":0.85071206805362,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-47307cc7-4f6e-3cd8-8398-0a205f368608_a-543cbc3d-f6e3-361e-b0df-8d5c43b9eb11","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/thats-aaron-rodgers-best-quarterback-planet-dw7btsu","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/thats-aaron-rodgers-best-quarterback-planet-233453432.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/19d2ed4ed4ab12963d8b3191e16ac5eb","title":"That's why Aaron Rodgers is the best quarterback on the planet","summary":"Aaron Rodgers is the best player in the NFL, and it's probably not close.
