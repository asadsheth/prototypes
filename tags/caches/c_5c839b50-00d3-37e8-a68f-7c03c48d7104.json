It may seem like a smaller detail when compared to some of the others, but the biggest inconstancy so far has been the timeline concerning the police\/security response to the incident:\n\nThere are armed security guards and\/or armed security contractors (ex military, law enforcement) working in most hotel\/casinos (especially in Vegas). The security guard being shot 6 minutes prior to the attack starting would have most likely alerted the armed security detail within the resort and they would have responded. This is of course unless the security guard was unable to relay his situation via radio. However, since he was sent to investigate an alarm on the same floor, his \"dispatch\" would have requested status checks via radio. If he did not answer, more security would have been sent. \n\nIt is reasonable to think once the attack started, unarmed security may have waited for police to respond.

I'm done with them and with the NFL.","id":"0bcc597d-b4f6-4274-907b-275691caf06e","context_id":"7e5deed0-c43b-33a3-a998-15cbf1c53a69","upvotes":100,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"jeff s","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","score":0.95911348815097,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-cbf3f509-4a68-36c5-a53b-b198e624ecf3_a-7e5deed0-c43b-33a3-a998-15cbf1c53a69","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/gerald-mccoy-says-apos-uproar-5jhyr1f","author":"third_watch","provider":"Sporting News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/gerald-mccoy-says-apos-uproar-162848876.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/article.sportingnews.com\/5f252d29179393f2d12cbf7de8e5b635","title":"Gerald McCoy says it will be an 'uproar' if NFL players are forced to stand during anthem","summary":"Gerald McCoy said that forcing a player to stand is \"taking away a constitutional right to freedom of speech.\"","published_at":1507739287,"content_id":"7e5deed0-c43b-33a3-a998-15cbf1c53a69","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/gerald-mccoy-says-apos-uproar-162848876.html","content_published_at":1507739328,"content_relative_time":23,"vibe_name":"Sports"},"created_at":1507742649,"comment_relative_time":22,"bot":false},{"text":"Great, another idiot \"athlete\".","id":"15934143-a06e-441b-8b47-e54d71999322","context_id":"68d014cd-eb51-3f95-924a-56e516154ceb","upvotes":117,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"NoMoreNFL","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/a1e25042de36e6e43a5f13b4fcfd8b80_192.png","score":0.9587858428056,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-dc71f8df-b5ab-3c9e-b91e-d71c8f64a572_a-68d014cd-eb51-3f95-924a-56e516154ceb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/alex-morgan-disney-incident-cant-imagine-black-people-go-1h3m638","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"FC Yahoo","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/alex-morgan-disney-incident-cant-imagine-black-people-go-195304014.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/d5085aac1f72c1439c8112f6668d1037","title":"Alex Morgan after Disney incident: 'I can't imagine what black people go through'","summary":"Police body cam footage also shows one of the two women in the room saying, \"I'm so glad I'm white.\" It's unclear if that is also Morgan.","published_at":1507751584,"content_id":"68d014cd-eb51-3f95-924a-56e516154ceb","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/alex-morgan-disney-incident-cant-imagine-black-people-go-195304014.html","content_published_at":1507751584,"content_relative_time":19,"vibe_name":"Sports"},"created_at":1507753181,"comment_relative_time":19,"bot":false},{"text":"I see a list of a 10 teams and players but when you read through them instead of count them, you see it's really less than that (\"formed a committee to talk to each\") or (\"talked to the NFL\").\nOnly a few (e.g. Cleveland, Seattle) show actual community activism to help bring about better relationships between the police and the citizens from both sides.

But don't do it a way that is disrespecting our flag and our country. That's where the entire message has become lost. Come out before the game or at the end of halftime and make speeches, defy the league dress code and wear things during games that promote the cause, start foundations, run media ads, work with the local communities and police departments... the list is endless. But the way they are promoting their cause today is not working.... and will fail. Let me ask a question... Of all the ongoing conversation about the players' protests, how much of it has actually been about how to reduce the number of unjustified police shootings? 5%? 1%? Less than that? But it's not too late. If the players change their approach and take a different path to achieve their good cause, they will find we will be behind them 100%. But until the players wake up and realize that they've taken the wrong path with the Anthem and the Flag, they will continue to suffer, along with the league... They will fail.

McAdoo was a QB coach prior to getting the OC job with the Giants, and he only held that for a couple years prior to moving up to head coach.

Dombro, new guy in town, not only underestimated the numerical contributions of David Ortiz, he failed to account for how the absence of that clutch, menacing bat in the middle of the order would affect the rest of the lineup. It wasn't just Hanley's production that fell through the floor in 2017. He then compounded the problem by trading Travis Shaw, who, almost predictably, had a breakout year offensively (.273, 31 HRs, 101RBI), for yet another injury-plagued middle reliever (Tyler Thornburg) who spent the entire 2017 season on the DL. My biggest fear is that, once other people wake up and realize what he's doing, Dombro will gut the remains of the farm system through desperate, lopsided trades before he's finally canned. This will join Red Sox folklore as the Curse of 'Lucky' Lucchino. If he had been put out to pasture years ago, I daresay Theo and Tito might still be here; Bobby Valentine (shudder!) might never have been hired; John Lester might still be near the top of their starting rotation. Each of these front-office clusters*cks (and others too numerous to name) have 'Lucky's' fingerprints all over them.

Thanks for 2013, John.","id":"750369cf-bb3c-4ab2-be32-a16f5293fad1","context_id":"f17cbcbd-0378-3a4e-9b88-c7ca7016da5f","upvotes":6,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"dennisd","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ad.jpg","score":0.71911575945596,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-e2da8688-ebfe-3b19-844d-022f948867ce_a-f17cbcbd-0378-3a4e-9b88-c7ca7016da5f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/red-sox-fire-manager-john-farrell-4y4t2up","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Big League Stew","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/red-sox-fire-manager-john-farrell-134937042.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/e774dce7d59fb635d18d99968ca53bc5","title":"Red Sox fire manager John Farrell after back-to-back division titles","summary":"The Red Sox have decided to move on from manager John Farrell.","published_at":1507729777,"content_id":"f17cbcbd-0378-3a4e-9b88-c7ca7016da5f","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/red-sox-fire-manager-john-farrell-134937042.html","content_published_at":1507729777,"content_relative_time":25,"vibe_name":"Sports"},"created_at":1507734183,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":false},{"text":"Glad what football players do is what consumes so much of the presidents time.

He has nothing left to prove in my opinion and should be an automatic for the Hall of Fame.","id":"07ca5a34-5ef1-40b1-8716-e6abe9235403","context_id":"1cdfe60e-e07e-33c6-b339-784913e4faba","upvotes":6,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Chris G.","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_C_jl.jpg","score":0.63286794713747,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-f32ebe65-e3e4-3e11-a389-c91a17ef1ff9_a-1cdfe60e-e07e-33c6-b339-784913e4faba","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/reports-saints-trade-adrian-peterson-cardinals-2pn5o8f","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/reports-saints-trade-adrian-peterson-cardinals-160941672.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/71e2b3ced204503bb5a9389b6ac5a57a","title":"Reports: Saints trade Adrian Peterson to Cardinals","summary":"Adrian Peterson wasn't playing much for the Saints, but should get more snaps in Arizona.","published_at":1507650713,"content_id":"1cdfe60e-e07e-33c6-b339-784913e4faba","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/reports-saints-trade-adrian-peterson-cardinals-160941672.html","content_published_at":1507651781,"content_relative_time":47,"vibe_name":"Sports"},"created_at":1507653429,"comment_relative_time":47,"bot":false},{"text":"Trouble with the Cardinals is very simple from someone who watches them every week.  It's the play calling.  I know what you're thinking it can't be.  But it is.  It's too easy to predict run or pass.  It's so obvious that's why chris johnson runs into a wall each time he gets the ball.  When Chris Johnson is in the game, predominantly they run.  When he comes out, predominantly they pass.  So defenses know this and stopping them is cake.  What they need to do is throw the ball to Chris Johnson who is an ample receiver to keep defenses guessing.  Peterson won't do any good and its stupid to bring him in.  Same thing, when he's in they are going to run.  Very ignorant and Arians only has himself to blame sadly.

I know lots of poor kids who love soccer and want to play it buy can't afford to joint any program. Here are few solutions I propose:\n1) Make kids' soccer programs competitive, available to all, and inexpensive. \n2)Make MLS a premier League in the world by paying players millions of $ like other European leagues. This will attract great talents and allow American kids or wonder kids to play with the best in soccer. As a result, American kids will learn from the best and by implementing those skills, they will become more competitive.\n3)Make soccer a national sport. Whenever USA men team play any game, it must be broadcasted anywhere on American soil and territory. By doing so, all these players will not only love playing soccer and wearing that national jersey, they will understand the they really are in other form US soldiers.","id":"e6f60e6d-a5d4-4a59-a618-52a3b2433330","context_id":"7b281c3d-c547-3f88-8d36-61f37db762b2","upvotes":6,"downvotes":4,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"The Doc","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_T_ald_4_6-16.jpg","score":0.56408310032132,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-53b7b082-913e-3c1b-854b-f9f1881f24ca_a-7b281c3d-c547-3f88-8d36-61f37db762b2","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/u-s-soccer-go-10-immediate-aftershocks-world-cup-failure-1f81k8u","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"FC Yahoo","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/u-s-soccer-go-10-immediate-aftershocks-world-cup-failure-102333859.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/4ac0014ced99d67541742ce7ced1b44c","title":"Where does U.S. Soccer go from here? 10 immediate aftershocks of World Cup failure","summary":"Arena is gone.

More people play now, and that is not bad. The game can be good exercise. But in terms of fan interest and TV interest, it is all but non-existent compared to the sports which Americans in large majority numbers follow. And the fact is that most good American athletes do not take up soccer, and those who do take it up are not nearly as good as the players other countries regularly produce. There are a couple of good Americans here and there (more women than men), but they almost seem odd and fluky, and their next-door neighbors probably do not know who they are. And that is how it should be. It is not an American sport, and if Americans had genuinely found it appealing, they would have taken it up in large numbers decades ago. It is a small niche sport and is likely to remain that way, and almost no one in America will care one way or the other if the USMT makes the World Cup or not.
