Come out before the game or at the end of halftime and make speeches, defy the league dress code and wear things during games that promote the cause, start foundations, run media ads, work with the local communities and police departments... the list is endless. But the way they are promoting their cause today is not working.... and will fail. Let me ask a question... Of all the ongoing conversation about the players' protests, how much of it has actually been about how to reduce the number of unjustified police shootings? 5%? 1%? Less than that? But it's not too late. If the players change their approach and take a different path to achieve their good cause, they will find we will be behind them 100%.

MAC A DOUCHE as I refer to him never had a clue last year, never had one this year and will never have one he is the one , along with Reese that should be fired, and if the owners dont have the balls to do it , they should sell the team instead of shaming their predecessors.......Its a crying shame to have to pay top dollar for an inferior product, and yes even with the ups and downs there is a different sense than the garbage my beloved franchise has become, As much as I hate Bellichek he does more with less , no prima donnas and gets rid of the cancers, ie: Beckham, the best thing that happen for that young man is his injury and Im sure he will come back a totally mature player after this. Screw MAC A DOUCHE AND REESE. The loyalty should be to the fans as we have become the laughing  stock of the NFL and the 2nd rate team of NYC","message_id":"f9bdc9cf-5abb-4ed9-ae53-9de0d6f76f8b","context_id":"4f48e326-92f0-3772-bb42-e3faa76f7244","upvotes":24,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":8,"author_name":"Shaned","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_S_kl.jpg","score":0.85519300102867,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-6bd8e1ef-be20-3fe2-acbe-7da29a2621b0_a-4f48e326-92f0-3772-bb42-e3faa76f7244","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/dominique-rodgers-cromartie-leaves-giants-facility-will-suspended-4m4dc74","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/dominique-rodgers-cromartie-leaves-giants-facility-will-suspended-181829131.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/7b9d63e93e4c0241f1f74f162a4b3ef2","title":"Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie leaves Giants facility, will be suspended","summary":"Veteran New York Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie will be suspended after leaving the team facilities Wednesday, coach Ben McAdoo said.","published_at":1507745909,"content_id":"4f48e326-92f0-3772-bb42-e3faa76f7244","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/dominique-rodgers-cromartie-leaves-giants-facility-will-suspended-181829131.html","content_published_at":1507745909,"content_relative_time":22,"vibe_name":"Sports"},"created_at":1507750485,"comment_relative_time":20,"bot":false},{"text":"Not a single player mentioned lives in a predominately black neighborhood.","message_id":"41884d6c-6602-4e10-b7d6-a6a4d6074d34","context_id":"8ed0efd7-bdbf-34e4-b741-fe3291e2c883","upvotes":71,"downvotes":2,"reports":1,"replies":2,"author_name":"Howie","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_H_ad.jpg","score":0.85492971410091,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-a03bd721-a60d-3510-af6f-7404af6ebcfa_a-8ed0efd7-bdbf-34e4-b741-fe3291e2c883","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/nfl-teams-charitable-efforts-part-protests-running-list-5ynkux2","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-teams-charitable-efforts-part-protests-running-list-134152884.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/1512b1a290c3e1301cc6702f8f4f5356","title":"NFL teams' charitable efforts as part of protests: a running list","summary":"Here's what NFL teams are doing in the wake of protests to help their communities.","published_at":1507815712,"content_id":"8ed0efd7-bdbf-34e4-b741-fe3291e2c883","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-teams-charitable-efforts-part-protests-running-list-134152884.html","content_published_at":1507815712,"content_relative_time":2,"vibe_name":"Sports"},"created_at":1507818383,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"These same players need to protest against those teammates who beat and abuse women.","message_id":"a85a844f-bb39-45dc-9075-d6e1136e9aa2","context_id":"8ed0efd7-bdbf-34e4-b741-fe3291e2c883","upvotes":61,"downvotes":0,"reports":1,"replies":3,"author_name":"Denise","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ad.jpg","score":0.85447022867353,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-a03bd721-a60d-3510-af6f-7404af6ebcfa_a-8ed0efd7-bdbf-34e4-b741-fe3291e2c883","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/nfl-teams-charitable-efforts-part-protests-running-list-5ynkux2","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-teams-charitable-efforts-part-protests-running-list-134152884.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/1512b1a290c3e1301cc6702f8f4f5356","title":"NFL teams' charitable efforts as part of protests: a running list","summary":"Here's what NFL teams are doing in the wake of protests to help their communities.","published_at":1507815712,"content_id":"8ed0efd7-bdbf-34e4-b741-fe3291e2c883","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-teams-charitable-efforts-part-protests-running-list-134152884.html","content_published_at":1507815712,"content_relative_time":2,"vibe_name":"Sports"},"created_at":1507818457,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"Buffoons.
