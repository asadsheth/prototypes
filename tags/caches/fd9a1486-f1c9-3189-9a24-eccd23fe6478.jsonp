A 2D survival horror game called Detention by Taiwanese developer Red Candle Games draws from that same country's history and culture to deliver its frights, and it's one of the eShop's hidden gems. Little Nightmares is a lean experience that\u00a0plays out like a creepy Germanic fairy tale rendered in a beautiful, but unsettling approximation of stop-motion film. In the game's campaign, you control a raincoat-clad little girl named Six through a bleak, poorly lit industrial environment called the Maw.","published_at":1528307997,"content_id":"6cdaa1aa-516a-3189-97e5-1334b206ea9e","content_url":"http:\/\/wegotthiscovered.com\/gaming\/little-nightmares-complete-edition-review\/","content_published_at":1528289306,"content_time":1528289306,"content_relative_time":27,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Video games","vibe_id":"fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478","content_type":"link","aspect":null},{"post_id":"v-fd9a1486-f1c9-3189-9a24-eccd23fe6478_c-d71d20af-9b7a-39a5-9163-2eab1535efb2_a-0fec3a42-cb60-3834-93e0-1ba787db278a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/video-games\/llamas-buildings-got-nerfed-fortnites-4momc5y","author":"third_watch","provider":"Polygon","provider_url":null,"provider_image":"","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/fortnite\/2018\/6\/6\/17434306\/fortnite-llama-nerf-patch-4-3-content-update","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/VcCoss0rAxTd6UoiGWBWNw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Tnl7K9N1PZfVn2JdEL3NTg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0fec3a42-cb60-3834-93e0-1ba787db278a-1231074241.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/qFYm6HxucBujygmHNVIIdw--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD02Mjg7dz0xMjAwOw--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Tnl7K9N1PZfVn2JdEL3NTg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0fec3a42-cb60-3834-93e0-1ba787db278a-1231074241.jpeg","height":628,"width":1200,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Tnl7K9N1PZfVn2JdEL3NTg--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjI4O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0fec3a42-cb60-3834-93e0-1ba787db278a-1231074241.jpeg","imgw":1200,"imgh":628,"title":"Llamas and buildings got nerfed in Fortnite's latest update","summary":"Early Tuesday morning, Epic Games released the first part of the content update for Fortnite Battle Royale patch version 4.3, which added the Bouncer trap. While it initially appeared that this was the only change the developer would make to the game this week, it seems Epic had a surprise in store. Around 8 p.m. ET that same day, when the shop changes, Epic released a wave of balance changes that are also part of this week's content update. The changes, according to Epic, are aimed at addressing concerns about building and resource availability. The first, and perhaps largest, change for most players is a nerf that Epic made to Supply Llamas.
