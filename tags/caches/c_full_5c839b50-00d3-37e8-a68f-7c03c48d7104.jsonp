It is literally historic. That's how lopsided the calls were. This never happened before and then add in the fact that a very similarly called game occurred last year, and without question, there is something wrong here.  \n\nI also love how they attempt to come up with the declined calls narrative where only two calls were declined by the Eagles, both which were basically automatic calls.  They also left out the fact that Carolina declined multiple calls as well, one of which I know was unquestionably subjective.","message_id":"b8532573-1ea6-44c9-8e50-eba66ebd9f9f","context_id":"1fe9f7ae-0caf-3ce4-b68e-76b7565065c5","upvotes":12,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"D","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ad.jpg","author_guid":"VBTZU7WJ7MT46YBMI2LQG7XNQ4","score":0.78975312700842,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-e7a622ea-58a3-37e6-b8fa-b0c5cf6bfcbe_a-1fe9f7ae-0caf-3ce4-b68e-76b7565065c5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/nfl-referees-association-refutes-claims-referee-pete-morelli-bias-vs-eagles-2tr9ym4","author":"nanook","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-referees-association-refutes-claims-referee-pete-morelli-bias-vs-eagles-164508675.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/b113b3d01f104eb88800b0e7ae25a16b","title":"NFL Referees Association refutes claims of referee Pete Morelli bias vs. Eagles","summary":"Philadelphia Eagles fans have been so loud about their distaste for referee Pete Morelli and his crew that the NFL Referees Association felt the need to put out a statement.","published_at":1508431508,"content_id":"1fe9f7ae-0caf-3ce4-b68e-76b7565065c5","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-referees-association-refutes-claims-referee-pete-morelli-bias-vs-eagles-164508675.html","content_published_at":1508431508,"content_relative_time":6,"vibe_name":"Sports","vibe_id":"5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104"},"created_at":1508435782,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":false},{"text":"the jet touchdown being overturned against the patriots got my attention.

The ball\/strike calls have to be made by the umpire.  Pitchers are now throwing with unprecedented speed and movement.  It is not possible for a human being to get them all right.  Just as in the game last night and every game played there are a number of pitches out of the zone called strikes and a lessor number of pitches in the zone called balls.  This could be corrected with a simple move to electronic calling.  The tech is there why not use it?

Lord Jesus I give you thanks for saving Harvey Langi and his wife, Cassidy, and giving them a chance to realize that you are come to give life and life more abundantly, I also give you thanks, Lord Jesus , for the other souls that were involved in the accident, Please save them all, Lord Jesus, and make them fit to enter the kingdom of God, in the name of Christ Jesus, Amen. I read Michael Duishka's, \"Corn Shelling Time\" where he reiterated the Word of God, and the prophecies of the bible are coming to pass right before our eyes, most especially the 4 horsemen in the book of Revelation. Our time is so short, Duishka said the time is here to shell down the corn, (confess our sins to Christ Jesus), REPENT, (turn from our wicked ways), and Believe Christ Jesus.","message_id":"a2e80f25-e66c-4b47-9b8e-9be40ae8c299","context_id":"9d7c9f45-18f8-384f-8522-c0cd4d634303","upvotes":25,"downvotes":8,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Florence","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_F_kl.jpg","author_guid":"LRXYJ24T4CJTPXXOGP3RR75YEQ","score":0.74813831152539,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-f8e1b0c3-caac-35cf-9547-aecbd30ba450_a-9d7c9f45-18f8-384f-8522-c0cd4d634303","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/patriots-lb-harvey-langis-wife-shares-emotional-reunion-car-accident-1y3zb5d","author":"third_watch","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/patriots-lb-harvey-langis-wife-shares-emotional-reunion-car-accident-010909997.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/07997939a722de2773f41c46172d21b7","title":"Patriots LB Harvey Langi's wife shares emotional reunion after car accident","summary":"Days after Patriots linebacker Harvey Langi and his wife, Cassidy, were injured in car accident, she posted a video on Instagram of their tearful reunion in the hospital.","published_at":1508391366,"content_id":"9d7c9f45-18f8-384f-8522-c0cd4d634303","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/patriots-lb-harvey-langis-wife-shares-emotional-reunion-car-accident-010909997.html","content_published_at":1508375349,"content_relative_time":21,"vibe_name":"Sports","vibe_id":"5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104"},"created_at":1508401289,"comment_relative_time":14,"bot":false},{"text":"Nobody comes into the Bronx in October and pushes the Yankees around.

You actually believe that judges and juries, made up of regular civilians, are allowing this stuff only because of skin color? The fact that twice as many white people are shot by the police every year, even though black people murder far people every year, isn't showing that the police will defend their lives against any color of person? I can show you a video of a kid a few weeks ago who was gunned down while unarmed. He was white though. Even with the clear video, where these racists should have been far more outraged than events like Michael Brown, these same people never cared... It's all proof of just how pathetic and racist everyone protesting over police violence is. You aren't protesting police violence. You only care about the skin color of the thug who got shot.\n\nThe police who execute people without justification are going to prison. There have been multiple officers charged and convicted in recent times because of this. \n\nAll statistics prove that this is nothing more than a racist movement. Reality, as in watching white people get shot with no one caring, proves that this is nothing but a racist movement. Liberals are all drama queens who just need to feel like they are victims.
