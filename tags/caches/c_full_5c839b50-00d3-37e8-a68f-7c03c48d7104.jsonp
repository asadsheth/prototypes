As far as replay goes I was initially against it, but have warmed up to it.  Replay forces these guys to be more fundamental with slides, tags, foot-on-base, etc.  Just because the ball beats the runner, the defender still needs to apply the proper tag.  In last nights case, the runner should slide and stay on the base.  That's the rule.  If your not on the base and you are tagged, you're out.  As far as holding the tag in case the runner pops off the bag, infielders have been doing this for years, way before replay.  The so called \"neighborhood\" play? That \"neighborhood\" thing used to award a bad throw from a middle infielder.  Again, replay has reigned in the fact that you must have your foot on the bag when you make a force play.  I do agree that Lobaton should not put himself in a position to be pick off in that situation.  Very bad mistake on his part.\n\nNo one is manipulating the system.  You're either on the base or you're not.  Keep it simple.

When the Nationals took the 4-1 lead everyone, and I mean everyone from the TBS commentators to the fans minus some Cubs fans truly believed the game was over. From what I have seen in this team I knew it was far from finished and the end result proved that.
