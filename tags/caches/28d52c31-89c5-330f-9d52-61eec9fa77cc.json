He was 85. Weitz died at his retirement home in Flagstaff, Arizona, on Monday, said Laura Cutchens of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation. No cause of death was given. A NASA biography says Weitz was among the class of 19 astronauts who were chosen in April 1966. He served as command module pilot on the first crew of the orbiting space laboratory known as Skylab during a 28-day mission in 1973. Weitz also commanded the first launch of the shuttle Challenger in April 1983.

Astronomers have confirmed the existence of thousands of exoplanets beyond our solar system, but so far the existence of an exomoon circling one of them is not quite official.
