Plenty of other spacecraft are out there exploring -- specifically Mars, Jupiter and even Pluto and objects on the edge of the solar system. Just look at the New Horizons mission, exploring the deepest reaches of our solar system -- most definitely where no man has gone before. New Horizons is preparing for a New Year's Day 2019 flyby of Kuiper Belt object MU69, the most distant object any spacecraft has explored, according to the flight plan recently announced by NASA.","published_at":1507579481,"content_id":"226ea679-9bde-378c-8b9c-450e5c94ffd0","content_url":"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/09\/us\/nasa-solar-system-missions\/index.html","content_published_at":1507537582,"content_relative_time":79,"vibe_name":"Astronomy"},{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-d596ff3f-496b-3c28-bc96-b74c1d674505_a-e1c6c2ec-6729-38bb-9a63-4290c155691b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/hubble-image-week-2eyg3d3","author":"third_watch","provider":"SciTech Daily","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/scitechdaily.com\/hubble-image-of-the-week-dwarf-galaxy-eso-553-46\/","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/dgDOancvabECxmekcDW8mw--\/dz03Nzc7aD00Mzc7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e1c6c2ec-6729-38bb-9a63-4290c155691b-108376746.jpeg","title":"Hubble Image of the Week","summary":"This newly released Hubble image of the week shows dwarf galaxy ESO 553-46, which is located roughly 20 million light-years away. As far as galaxies are concerned, size can be deceptive. Some of the largest galaxies in the Universe are dormant, while some dwarf galaxies, such as ESO 553-46 imaged here by the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, can produce stars at a hair-raising rate. In fact, ESO 553-46 has one of the highest rates of star formation of the 1000 or so galaxies nearest to the Milky Way. No mean feat for such a diminutive galaxy!
