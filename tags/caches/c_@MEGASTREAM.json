To boost this process night creams tend to be packed full of ingredients, such as retinol and vitamin C, which help increase cell turnover and smooth and hydrate your skin.\u00a0 Finding the right overnight product is almost as essential as getting your recommended eight hours of sleep. Here are the products we recommend...\u00a0\u00a0 The best hydrating night cream Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask, \u00a330\u00a0\u00a0 For those that need a extra boost of moisturise, it's worth switching your night cream for a mask throughout winter or for two-to-three nights a week. Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask is packed full of nourishing ingredients and has the most creamy soft texture. Apply from the decolletage upwards and pat on an extra layer where required. I guarantee you will wake up with plumper, firmer, more radiant skin.\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for lines and wrinkles Cult 51 Night Cream, \u00a3125\u00a0 There are plenty of lotions and potions that promise to smooth and plump your skin while you sleep, but few can back up their claims quite like Cult 51. The cream promises to target all five signs of ageing and has independent clinical studies to prove that within 28 days you could see 52 percent improvement in your lines and wrinkles. Admittedly these kind of results do come with a hefty price tag, but if you're serious about ageing, this is worth the investment. \u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for pigmentation Dr Dennis Gross Ferulic and Retinol Wrinkle Recovery Overnight Serum, \u00a377 While this isn't technically a 'night cream', this potent serum is one of the best solutions to pigmentation that I've come across. The blend of retinol and ferulic acid helps to even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of dark spots. Don't expect overnight miracles though, you do have to persevere for at least 12 weeks to see improvement.\u00a0 Buy now How retinoids work in your skincare products 02:14 The best night cream for sensitive skin\u00a0 La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Overnight Care, \u00a313.12 La Roche Posay's Toleriane range has a reputation for being one of the very best skincare ranges\u00a0for sensitive skin and four of the products are approved by the British Allergy Foundation. The latest offering is the Ultra Overnight Care, which helps to soothe inflammation and irritation, as well as reduce your skin's sensitivity. It's also provides a hydrating boost without feeling heavy on your skin. To be honest, it's a great night cream even if you don't have sensitive skin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for oily skin\u00a0 Paula's Choice Skin Balancing Invisible Finish Moisture Gel, \u00a325 If you battle with oily, blemish-prone skin\u00a0applying a thick, rich cream\u00a0might be the last thing you want to do before getting into bed. With this in mind, skincare expert Paula Begoun created this gel-textured moisturiser, which can conveniently be used as both your day and night cream. It's lightweight, it mattifies and it doesn't clog your pores, which can exacerbate oiliness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now \u00a0","published_at":1509097251,"content_id":"1a00f4ec-f7fe-3863-93c6-869119a0e95c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/clocks-back-weekend-test-best-094051385.html","content_published_at":1509097251,"content_relative_time":6,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509117721,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"In the UK the clocks to go back this weekend.

To boost this process night creams tend to be packed full of ingredients, such as retinol and vitamin C, which help increase cell turnover and smooth and hydrate your skin.\u00a0 Finding the right overnight product is almost as essential as getting your recommended eight hours of sleep.

To boost this process night creams tend to be packed full of ingredients, such as retinol and vitamin C, which help increase cell turnover and smooth and hydrate your skin.\u00a0 Finding the right overnight product is almost as essential as getting your recommended eight hours of sleep. Here are the products we recommend...\u00a0\u00a0 The best hydrating night cream Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask, \u00a330\u00a0\u00a0 For those that need a extra boost of moisturise, it's worth switching your night cream for a mask throughout winter or for two-to-three nights a week. Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask is packed full of nourishing ingredients and has the most creamy soft texture. Apply from the decolletage upwards and pat on an extra layer where required. I guarantee you will wake up with plumper, firmer, more radiant skin.\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for lines and wrinkles Cult 51 Night Cream, \u00a3125\u00a0 There are plenty of lotions and potions that promise to smooth and plump your skin while you sleep, but few can back up their claims quite like Cult 51. The cream promises to target all five signs of ageing and has independent clinical studies to prove that within 28 days you could see 52 percent improvement in your lines and wrinkles. Admittedly these kind of results do come with a hefty price tag, but if you're serious about ageing, this is worth the investment. \u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for pigmentation Dr Dennis Gross Ferulic and Retinol Wrinkle Recovery Overnight Serum, \u00a377 While this isn't technically a 'night cream', this potent serum is one of the best solutions to pigmentation that I've come across. The blend of retinol and ferulic acid helps to even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of dark spots. Don't expect overnight miracles though, you do have to persevere for at least 12 weeks to see improvement.\u00a0 Buy now How retinoids work in your skincare products 02:14 The best night cream for sensitive skin\u00a0 La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Overnight Care, \u00a313.12 La Roche Posay's Toleriane range has a reputation for being one of the very best skincare ranges\u00a0for sensitive skin and four of the products are approved by the British Allergy Foundation. The latest offering is the Ultra Overnight Care, which helps to soothe inflammation and irritation, as well as reduce your skin's sensitivity. It's also provides a hydrating boost without feeling heavy on your skin. To be honest, it's a great night cream even if you don't have sensitive skin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for oily skin\u00a0 Paula's Choice Skin Balancing Invisible Finish Moisture Gel, \u00a325 If you battle with oily, blemish-prone skin\u00a0applying a thick, rich cream\u00a0might be the last thing you want to do before getting into bed.

To boost this process night creams tend to be packed full of ingredients, such as retinol and vitamin C, which help increase cell turnover and smooth and hydrate your skin.\u00a0 Finding the right overnight product is almost as essential as getting your recommended eight hours of sleep. Here are the products we recommend...\u00a0\u00a0 The best hydrating night cream Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask, \u00a330\u00a0\u00a0 For those that need a extra boost of moisturise, it's worth switching your night cream for a mask throughout winter or for two-to-three nights a week. Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask is packed full of nourishing ingredients and has the most creamy soft texture. Apply from the decolletage upwards and pat on an extra layer where required. I guarantee you will wake up with plumper, firmer, more radiant skin.\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for lines and wrinkles Cult 51 Night Cream, \u00a3125\u00a0 There are plenty of lotions and potions that promise to smooth and plump your skin while you sleep, but few can back up their claims quite like Cult 51. The cream promises to target all five signs of ageing and has independent clinical studies to prove that within 28 days you could see 52 percent improvement in your lines and wrinkles. Admittedly these kind of results do come with a hefty price tag, but if you're serious about ageing, this is worth the investment. \u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for pigmentation Dr Dennis Gross Ferulic and Retinol Wrinkle Recovery Overnight Serum, \u00a377 While this isn't technically a 'night cream', this potent serum is one of the best solutions to pigmentation that I've come across. The blend of retinol and ferulic acid helps to even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of dark spots. Don't expect overnight miracles though, you do have to persevere for at least 12 weeks to see improvement.\u00a0 Buy now How retinoids work in your skincare products 02:14 The best night cream for sensitive skin\u00a0 La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Overnight Care, \u00a313.12 La Roche Posay's Toleriane range has a reputation for being one of the very best skincare ranges\u00a0for sensitive skin and four of the products are approved by the British Allergy Foundation. The latest offering is the Ultra Overnight Care, which helps to soothe inflammation and irritation, as well as reduce your skin's sensitivity. It's also provides a hydrating boost without feeling heavy on your skin. To be honest, it's a great night cream even if you don't have sensitive skin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for oily skin\u00a0 Paula's Choice Skin Balancing Invisible Finish Moisture Gel, \u00a325 If you battle with oily, blemish-prone skin\u00a0applying a thick, rich cream\u00a0might be the last thing you want to do before getting into bed. With this in mind, skincare expert Paula Begoun created this gel-textured moisturiser, which can conveniently be used as both your day and night cream. It's lightweight, it mattifies and it doesn't clog your pores, which can exacerbate oiliness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now \u00a0","published_at":1509097251,"content_id":"1a00f4ec-f7fe-3863-93c6-869119a0e95c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/clocks-back-weekend-test-best-094051385.html","content_published_at":1509097251,"content_relative_time":6,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509118491,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"LOCK HER UP!!!!

To boost this process night creams tend to be packed full of ingredients, such as retinol and vitamin C, which help increase cell turnover and smooth and hydrate your skin.\u00a0 Finding the right overnight product is almost as essential as getting your recommended eight hours of sleep. Here are the products we recommend...\u00a0\u00a0 The best hydrating night cream Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask, \u00a330\u00a0\u00a0 For those that need a extra boost of moisturise, it's worth switching your night cream for a mask throughout winter or for two-to-three nights a week. Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask is packed full of nourishing ingredients and has the most creamy soft texture. Apply from the decolletage upwards and pat on an extra layer where required. I guarantee you will wake up with plumper, firmer, more radiant skin.\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for lines and wrinkles Cult 51 Night Cream, \u00a3125\u00a0 There are plenty of lotions and potions that promise to smooth and plump your skin while you sleep, but few can back up their claims quite like Cult 51. The cream promises to target all five signs of ageing and has independent clinical studies to prove that within 28 days you could see 52 percent improvement in your lines and wrinkles. Admittedly these kind of results do come with a hefty price tag, but if you're serious about ageing, this is worth the investment. \u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for pigmentation Dr Dennis Gross Ferulic and Retinol Wrinkle Recovery Overnight Serum, \u00a377 While this isn't technically a 'night cream', this potent serum is one of the best solutions to pigmentation that I've come across. The blend of retinol and ferulic acid helps to even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of dark spots. Don't expect overnight miracles though, you do have to persevere for at least 12 weeks to see improvement.\u00a0 Buy now How retinoids work in your skincare products 02:14 The best night cream for sensitive skin\u00a0 La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Overnight Care, \u00a313.12 La Roche Posay's Toleriane range has a reputation for being one of the very best skincare ranges\u00a0for sensitive skin and four of the products are approved by the British Allergy Foundation. The latest offering is the Ultra Overnight Care, which helps to soothe inflammation and irritation, as well as reduce your skin's sensitivity. It's also provides a hydrating boost without feeling heavy on your skin. To be honest, it's a great night cream even if you don't have sensitive skin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for oily skin\u00a0 Paula's Choice Skin Balancing Invisible Finish Moisture Gel, \u00a325 If you battle with oily, blemish-prone skin\u00a0applying a thick, rich cream\u00a0might be the last thing you want to do before getting into bed. With this in mind, skincare expert Paula Begoun created this gel-textured moisturiser, which can conveniently be used as both your day and night cream. It's lightweight, it mattifies and it doesn't clog your pores, which can exacerbate oiliness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now \u00a0","published_at":1509097251,"content_id":"1a00f4ec-f7fe-3863-93c6-869119a0e95c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/clocks-back-weekend-test-best-094051385.html","content_published_at":1509097251,"content_relative_time":6,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509118976,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"Even though our President says inappropriate things, tweets, and makes the U.S. look a little crazy...

To boost this process night creams tend to be packed full of ingredients, such as retinol and vitamin C, which help increase cell turnover and smooth and hydrate your skin.\u00a0 Finding the right overnight product is almost as essential as getting your recommended eight hours of sleep. Here are the products we recommend...\u00a0\u00a0 The best hydrating night cream Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask, \u00a330\u00a0\u00a0 For those that need a extra boost of moisturise, it's worth switching your night cream for a mask throughout winter or for two-to-three nights a week. Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask is packed full of nourishing ingredients and has the most creamy soft texture. Apply from the decolletage upwards and pat on an extra layer where required. I guarantee you will wake up with plumper, firmer, more radiant skin.\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for lines and wrinkles Cult 51 Night Cream, \u00a3125\u00a0 There are plenty of lotions and potions that promise to smooth and plump your skin while you sleep, but few can back up their claims quite like Cult 51. The cream promises to target all five signs of ageing and has independent clinical studies to prove that within 28 days you could see 52 percent improvement in your lines and wrinkles. Admittedly these kind of results do come with a hefty price tag, but if you're serious about ageing, this is worth the investment. \u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for pigmentation Dr Dennis Gross Ferulic and Retinol Wrinkle Recovery Overnight Serum, \u00a377 While this isn't technically a 'night cream', this potent serum is one of the best solutions to pigmentation that I've come across. The blend of retinol and ferulic acid helps to even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of dark spots. Don't expect overnight miracles though, you do have to persevere for at least 12 weeks to see improvement.\u00a0 Buy now How retinoids work in your skincare products 02:14 The best night cream for sensitive skin\u00a0 La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Overnight Care, \u00a313.12 La Roche Posay's Toleriane range has a reputation for being one of the very best skincare ranges\u00a0for sensitive skin and four of the products are approved by the British Allergy Foundation. The latest offering is the Ultra Overnight Care, which helps to soothe inflammation and irritation, as well as reduce your skin's sensitivity. It's also provides a hydrating boost without feeling heavy on your skin. To be honest, it's a great night cream even if you don't have sensitive skin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for oily skin\u00a0 Paula's Choice Skin Balancing Invisible Finish Moisture Gel, \u00a325 If you battle with oily, blemish-prone skin\u00a0applying a thick, rich cream\u00a0might be the last thing you want to do before getting into bed. With this in mind, skincare expert Paula Begoun created this gel-textured moisturiser, which can conveniently be used as both your day and night cream. It's lightweight, it mattifies and it doesn't clog your pores, which can exacerbate oiliness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now \u00a0","published_at":1509097251,"content_id":"1a00f4ec-f7fe-3863-93c6-869119a0e95c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/clocks-back-weekend-test-best-094051385.html","content_published_at":1509097251,"content_relative_time":6,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509118701,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"I like how she made the switch from portrait to landscape","message_id":"a91140ae-1a95-4dee-9d72-ad4ba9cb42d6","context_id":"842278fc-69c2-3e83-9ecf-6a6c270c085e","upvotes":8,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"Michelle","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_M_mr.jpg","author_guid":"36Q75QDILU3LAYU7G6WUUEBYY4","score":0.72445728467099,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-842278fc-69c2-3e83-9ecf-6a6c270c085e_a-842278fc-69c2-3e83-9ecf-6a6c270c085e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/pets\/v-3b2a0de9-9898-3b2b-9c3d-25fa6d4916d9_c-842278fc-69c2-3e83-9ecf-6a6c270c085e_a-842278fc-69c2-3e83-9ecf-6a6c270c085e","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Rumble","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/ca.news.yahoo.com\/tense-standoff-between-dog-giant-135508415.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-CA\/video\/video.rumble.com\/c40cc0bc285121f1c61e60da7b1bcef2","title":"Tense standoff between dog and giant swan","summary":null,"published_at":1509112508,"content_id":"842278fc-69c2-3e83-9ecf-6a6c270c085e","content_url":"https:\/\/ca.news.yahoo.com\/tense-standoff-between-dog-giant-135508415.html","content_published_at":1509112508,"content_relative_time":2,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509117634,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"I was looking at the video after reading a post here about just putting the sails up.

Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask is packed full of nourishing ingredients and has the most creamy soft texture. Apply from the decolletage upwards and pat on an extra layer where required.

The cream promises to target all five signs of ageing and has independent clinical studies to prove that within 28 days you could see 52 percent improvement in your lines and wrinkles.

To boost this process night creams tend to be packed full of ingredients, such as retinol and vitamin C, which help increase cell turnover and smooth and hydrate your skin.\u00a0 Finding the right overnight product is almost as essential as getting your recommended eight hours of sleep. Here are the products we recommend...\u00a0\u00a0 The best hydrating night cream Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask, \u00a330\u00a0\u00a0 For those that need a extra boost of moisturise, it's worth switching your night cream for a mask throughout winter or for two-to-three nights a week. Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask is packed full of nourishing ingredients and has the most creamy soft texture. Apply from the decolletage upwards and pat on an extra layer where required. I guarantee you will wake up with plumper, firmer, more radiant skin.\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for lines and wrinkles Cult 51 Night Cream, \u00a3125\u00a0 There are plenty of lotions and potions that promise to smooth and plump your skin while you sleep, but few can back up their claims quite like Cult 51. The cream promises to target all five signs of ageing and has independent clinical studies to prove that within 28 days you could see 52 percent improvement in your lines and wrinkles. Admittedly these kind of results do come with a hefty price tag, but if you're serious about ageing, this is worth the investment. \u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for pigmentation Dr Dennis Gross Ferulic and Retinol Wrinkle Recovery Overnight Serum, \u00a377 While this isn't technically a 'night cream', this potent serum is one of the best solutions to pigmentation that I've come across. The blend of retinol and ferulic acid helps to even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of dark spots. Don't expect overnight miracles though, you do have to persevere for at least 12 weeks to see improvement.\u00a0 Buy now How retinoids work in your skincare products 02:14 The best night cream for sensitive skin\u00a0 La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Overnight Care, \u00a313.12 La Roche Posay's Toleriane range has a reputation for being one of the very best skincare ranges\u00a0for sensitive skin and four of the products are approved by the British Allergy Foundation. The latest offering is the Ultra Overnight Care, which helps to soothe inflammation and irritation, as well as reduce your skin's sensitivity. It's also provides a hydrating boost without feeling heavy on your skin. To be honest, it's a great night cream even if you don't have sensitive skin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for oily skin\u00a0 Paula's Choice Skin Balancing Invisible Finish Moisture Gel, \u00a325 If you battle with oily, blemish-prone skin\u00a0applying a thick, rich cream\u00a0might be the last thing you want to do before getting into bed.

To boost this process night creams tend to be packed full of ingredients, such as retinol and vitamin C, which help increase cell turnover and smooth and hydrate your skin.\u00a0 Finding the right overnight product is almost as essential as getting your recommended eight hours of sleep. Here are the products we recommend...\u00a0\u00a0 The best hydrating night cream Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask, \u00a330\u00a0\u00a0 For those that need a extra boost of moisturise, it's worth switching your night cream for a mask throughout winter or for two-to-three nights a week. Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask is packed full of nourishing ingredients and has the most creamy soft texture. Apply from the decolletage upwards and pat on an extra layer where required. I guarantee you will wake up with plumper, firmer, more radiant skin.\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for lines and wrinkles Cult 51 Night Cream, \u00a3125\u00a0 There are plenty of lotions and potions that promise to smooth and plump your skin while you sleep, but few can back up their claims quite like Cult 51. The cream promises to target all five signs of ageing and has independent clinical studies to prove that within 28 days you could see 52 percent improvement in your lines and wrinkles. Admittedly these kind of results do come with a hefty price tag, but if you're serious about ageing, this is worth the investment. \u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for pigmentation Dr Dennis Gross Ferulic and Retinol Wrinkle Recovery Overnight Serum, \u00a377 While this isn't technically a 'night cream', this potent serum is one of the best solutions to pigmentation that I've come across. The blend of retinol and ferulic acid helps to even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of dark spots. Don't expect overnight miracles though, you do have to persevere for at least 12 weeks to see improvement.\u00a0 Buy now How retinoids work in your skincare products 02:14 The best night cream for sensitive skin\u00a0 La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Overnight Care, \u00a313.12 La Roche Posay's Toleriane range has a reputation for being one of the very best skincare ranges\u00a0for sensitive skin and four of the products are approved by the British Allergy Foundation. The latest offering is the Ultra Overnight Care, which helps to soothe inflammation and irritation, as well as reduce your skin's sensitivity. It's also provides a hydrating boost without feeling heavy on your skin. To be honest, it's a great night cream even if you don't have sensitive skin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now The best night cream for oily skin\u00a0 Paula's Choice Skin Balancing Invisible Finish Moisture Gel, \u00a325 If you battle with oily, blemish-prone skin\u00a0applying a thick, rich cream\u00a0might be the last thing you want to do before getting into bed. With this in mind, skincare expert Paula Begoun created this gel-textured moisturiser, which can conveniently be used as both your day and night cream. It's lightweight, it mattifies and it doesn't clog your pores, which can exacerbate oiliness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy now \u00a0","published_at":1509097251,"content_id":"1a00f4ec-f7fe-3863-93c6-869119a0e95c","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/clocks-back-weekend-test-best-094051385.html","content_published_at":1509097251,"content_relative_time":6,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509118572,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"Shark attacks?

Mecklenburg has had 60 bites reported since March 1.","summary":"Wondering why the Charlotte area has recently had a lot of copperhead bites, with four reports over a two-week span?

Guards are traditionally assigned to statues and other landmarks designed to unite the North Korean people behind their leadership on national holidays and anniversaries linked to the Kim family, but that protection is being stepped up. \"Agencies have constantly been saying 'Use lights to illuminate statues and paintings of the three generals of the Mount Paekyu bloodline [the Kim dynasty] and thoroughly care for them to ensure that hostile elements cannot damage them',\"\u00a0a source in Pyongyang told the dissident publication. \"There have been reports of incidents targeting these statues and monuments to the Kim family, particularly in the more remote areas of the country,\"\u00a0said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korea's ruling family.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has already warned of \"a sharp increase of food insecurity levels\" and other agencies have warned of widespread hunger among the population. Pyongyang has also requested assistance from the UN to feed its people, a step it has not had to take for several years. \"Despite all his promises, Kim Jong-un has had no significant successes and the people know it,\"\u00a0Professor Shigemura said. \"People want food and better living standards; they do not care about nuclear weapons and missiles and they are asking why so much is being spent on them when they are hungry.\"","published_at":1509010616,"content_id":"7aadadce-be87-33bd-b46f-7c4a00d6948b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-steps-security-around-093656054.html","content_published_at":1509010616,"content_relative_time":30,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509102773,"comment_relative_time":4,"bot":false},{"text":"Is this the dirtbag that continuously cheated on his wife, cut off her funds, didn't even go to the hospital when her appendix burst, then left her?

Citing its sources within North Korea, the Seoul-based Daily NK news web site said police \"have been mobilised for night patrols\" around statues dedicated to the three generations of the Kim family that have ruled the nation since 1945, while additional care is being taken across the country to protect wall murals and oil paintings in public places that extol their heroic achievements. Guards are traditionally assigned to statues and other landmarks designed to unite the North Korean people behind their leadership on national holidays and anniversaries linked to the Kim family, but that protection is being stepped up. \"Agencies have constantly been saying 'Use lights to illuminate statues and paintings of the three generals of the Mount Paekyu bloodline [the Kim dynasty] and thoroughly care for them to ensure that hostile elements cannot damage them',\"\u00a0a source in Pyongyang told the dissident publication. \"There have been reports of incidents targeting these statues and monuments to the Kim family, particularly in the more remote areas of the country,\"\u00a0said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korea's ruling family. Statues of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il Credit: REUTERS\u00a0 \"And, in comparison with the past, these incidents are becoming more frequent,\"\u00a0he told The Telegraph. \"Younger generations of North Koreans have little respect for Kim Jong-un and we are beginning to see that come to the surface,\" he said. People want food and better living standards; they do not care about nuclear weapons and missiles and they are asking why so much is being spent on them when they are hungry \"And local authorities have no choice but to increase security around these monuments because it could cost them their jobs - or worse - if such protests begin to spread.\"\u00a0 Discontent with the regime may well increase in the coming months, after North Korea suffered a severe drought at the beginning of its crop growing season, which will inevitably have an impact on the harvest. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has already warned of \"a sharp increase of food insecurity levels\" and other agencies have warned of widespread hunger among the population. Pyongyang has also requested assistance from the UN to feed its people, a step it has not had to take for several years. \"Despite all his promises, Kim Jong-un has had no significant successes and the people know it,\"\u00a0Professor Shigemura said. \"People want food and better living standards; they do not care about nuclear weapons and missiles and they are asking why so much is being spent on them when they are hungry.\"","published_at":1509010616,"content_id":"7aadadce-be87-33bd-b46f-7c4a00d6948b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-steps-security-around-093656054.html","content_published_at":1509010616,"content_relative_time":30,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509101839,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":false},{"text":"I carry !","message_id":"c7f2151a-41fd-4502-b76c-25cd19c4a02e","context_id":"288f49c2-fb9a-3951-bc5c-1100176d98e8","upvotes":10,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":3,"author_name":"Dave","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/13660b85e90c635fa147beac68c960c4_192.jpg","author_guid":"A5JQZFHJRH7OATQ2C7WAJ3IPUI","score":0.76153220372494,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dd323ebb-416a-3b40-b6ef-7e9c677f40d2_c-288f49c2-fb9a-3951-bc5c-1100176d98e8_a-288f49c2-fb9a-3951-bc5c-1100176d98e8","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/news\/v-dd323ebb-416a-3b40-b6ef-7e9c677f40d2_c-288f49c2-fb9a-3951-bc5c-1100176d98e8_a-288f49c2-fb9a-3951-bc5c-1100176d98e8","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"New York Post","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/10\/26\/woman-gets-knocked-out-cold-bystanders-stop-to-take-selfies\/","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Ohi.cYfTRW7tWpe3M1_X5Q--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9ODAwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_288f49c2-fb9a-3951-bc5c-1100176d98e8--868262252.jpeg","title":"Woman gets knocked out cold, bystanders stop to take selfies","summary":"Shocking surveillance video shows the moment a Pittsburgh woman was knocked out cold by a man on a busy sidewalk \u2014 but that's not the worst of it.

Citing its sources within North Korea, the Seoul-based Daily NK news web site said police \"have been mobilised for night patrols\" around statues dedicated to the three generations of the Kim family that have ruled the nation since 1945, while additional care is being taken across the country to protect wall murals and oil paintings in public places that extol their heroic achievements. Guards are traditionally assigned to statues and other landmarks designed to unite the North Korean people behind their leadership on national holidays and anniversaries linked to the Kim family, but that protection is being stepped up. \"Agencies have constantly been saying 'Use lights to illuminate statues and paintings of the three generals of the Mount Paekyu bloodline [the Kim dynasty] and thoroughly care for them to ensure that hostile elements cannot damage them',\"\u00a0a source in Pyongyang told the dissident publication. \"There have been reports of incidents targeting these statues and monuments to the Kim family, particularly in the more remote areas of the country,\"\u00a0said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korea's ruling family. Statues of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il Credit: REUTERS\u00a0 \"And, in comparison with the past, these incidents are becoming more frequent,\"\u00a0he told The Telegraph. \"Younger generations of North Koreans have little respect for Kim Jong-un and we are beginning to see that come to the surface,\" he said. People want food and better living standards; they do not care about nuclear weapons and missiles and they are asking why so much is being spent on them when they are hungry \"And local authorities have no choice but to increase security around these monuments because it could cost them their jobs - or worse - if such protests begin to spread.\"\u00a0 Discontent with the regime may well increase in the coming months, after North Korea suffered a severe drought at the beginning of its crop growing season, which will inevitably have an impact on the harvest. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has already warned of \"a sharp increase of food insecurity levels\" and other agencies have warned of widespread hunger among the population. Pyongyang has also requested assistance from the UN to feed its people, a step it has not had to take for several years. \"Despite all his promises, Kim Jong-un has had no significant successes and the people know it,\"\u00a0Professor Shigemura said. \"People want food and better living standards; they do not care about nuclear weapons and missiles and they are asking why so much is being spent on them when they are hungry.\"","published_at":1509010616,"content_id":"7aadadce-be87-33bd-b46f-7c4a00d6948b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-steps-security-around-093656054.html","content_published_at":1509010616,"content_relative_time":30,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509100687,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":false},{"text":"HILLARY MADE UP THE LIE ABOUT RUSSIA.","message_id":"bef32296-9884-44b5-acc4-e900620ce754","context_id":"3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b","upvotes":12,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"HILLARYLOST","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_H_kl_2_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"2US3ZLVVRUC4HOIF2T62LGB77U","score":0.72757957988582,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b_a-3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b_a-3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"People","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/rolling-stone-apos-jann-wenner-163242105.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/people_218\/2b98ada43fc2728a5ce40050c7b7bf29","title":"Rolling Stone's Jann Wenner on Coming Out to Wife of 26 Years: Inside the Drugs and Infidelity that Plagued the Pair","summary":"Inside Jann Wenner's Decision to Come Out to His Wife of 26 Years","published_at":1509035742,"content_id":"3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/rolling-stone-apos-jann-wenner-163242105.html","content_published_at":1509035742,"content_relative_time":23,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509103919,"comment_relative_time":4,"bot":false},{"text":"I never understood the double standard but it's obviously a liberal condition.

Citing its sources within North Korea, the Seoul-based Daily NK news web site said police \"have been mobilised for night patrols\" around statues dedicated to the three generations of the Kim family that have ruled the nation since 1945, while additional care is being taken across the country to protect wall murals and oil paintings in public places that extol their heroic achievements. Guards are traditionally assigned to statues and other landmarks designed to unite the North Korean people behind their leadership on national holidays and anniversaries linked to the Kim family, but that protection is being stepped up. \"Agencies have constantly been saying 'Use lights to illuminate statues and paintings of the three generals of the Mount Paekyu bloodline [the Kim dynasty] and thoroughly care for them to ensure that hostile elements cannot damage them',\"\u00a0a source in Pyongyang told the dissident publication. \"There have been reports of incidents targeting these statues and monuments to the Kim family, particularly in the more remote areas of the country,\"\u00a0said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korea's ruling family. Statues of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il Credit: REUTERS\u00a0 \"And, in comparison with the past, these incidents are becoming more frequent,\"\u00a0he told The Telegraph. \"Younger generations of North Koreans have little respect for Kim Jong-un and we are beginning to see that come to the surface,\" he said. People want food and better living standards; they do not care about nuclear weapons and missiles and they are asking why so much is being spent on them when they are hungry \"And local authorities have no choice but to increase security around these monuments because it could cost them their jobs - or worse - if such protests begin to spread.\"\u00a0 Discontent with the regime may well increase in the coming months, after North Korea suffered a severe drought at the beginning of its crop growing season, which will inevitably have an impact on the harvest. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has already warned of \"a sharp increase of food insecurity levels\" and other agencies have warned of widespread hunger among the population. Pyongyang has also requested assistance from the UN to feed its people, a step it has not had to take for several years. \"Despite all his promises, Kim Jong-un has had no significant successes and the people know it,\"\u00a0Professor Shigemura said. \"People want food and better living standards; they do not care about nuclear weapons and missiles and they are asking why so much is being spent on them when they are hungry.\"","published_at":1509010616,"content_id":"7aadadce-be87-33bd-b46f-7c4a00d6948b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-steps-security-around-093656054.html","content_published_at":1509010616,"content_relative_time":30,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509100771,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":false},{"text":"Just two more secretly gay white guys.","message_id":"a60c809f-166f-4a6a-97de-1eebde2cff5f","context_id":"3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b","upvotes":18,"downvotes":8,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Jayson","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"DO4RZ2XRBDRFKNF5XWAIVUK7GQ","score":0.68734759703816,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b_a-3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/entertainment\/v-7563eca7-14c1-3a20-ab16-782788cde33a_c-3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b_a-3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"People","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/rolling-stone-apos-jann-wenner-163242105.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/people_218\/2b98ada43fc2728a5ce40050c7b7bf29","title":"Rolling Stone's Jann Wenner on Coming Out to Wife of 26 Years: Inside the Drugs and Infidelity that Plagued the Pair","summary":"Inside Jann Wenner's Decision to Come Out to His Wife of 26 Years","published_at":1509035742,"content_id":"3c2e37ae-1f15-3288-9402-76f876f7fe6b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/rolling-stone-apos-jann-wenner-163242105.html","content_published_at":1509035742,"content_relative_time":23,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509103871,"comment_relative_time":4,"bot":false},{"text":"and I am guessing that it was NOT the cannabis that made over does and die. smoke cannabis people it is safer than cigarettes, Liquor, Tylenol, even Falling coconuts kill an estimated 5 people a year world wide...

I had the worst diarrhea of my life a few months ago after eating at Applebee's. I got sick while I was in the mall and it hit very suddenly. The closest toilet was in Sears so I waddled as fast as I could to get to the bathroom before a river of brown erupted from my butt. Alas I discovered that the only bathroom in Sears was on the second floor, so after futilely searching I had to make for the escalator. I could feel the butt-volcano about to erupt, I was frantic. I thought OK, almost there, I can make it, and then I learned that the bathroom was all the way on the far side of the store from the escalator! This was bad, really bad. I had my sphincter clenched as tight as I could but I knew I had only seconds left and the bathroom was about half a minute away. If I sprinted I could make it, but if I sprinted I wouldn't be able to properly clench my sphincter. I was stuck. I did the best I could, and I even made it to the bathroom, but before I could get to the stall Mt. Buttuvius erupted in my pants. And it just kept coming. I waddled to the stall with a brown geyser shooting from my bum, got my pants down, and my butt kept spraying like the world's most foul fire hose. It got all over the seat, the toilet, the walls, the floor, there was even some on the ceiling. The CEILING! I had to pant and breathe deeply but the smell was so bad I almost vomited. So there I was, in Sears, my pants a wet, slimy, nasty brown. The only good thing was that there wasn't anybody in there, and all through my struggle, nobody else came in. I did what I had to do. I used two entire rolls of toilet paper to try to clean up, and I had to try to flush my underwear into the toilet. As you can imagine, this didn't work, so the toilet overflowed and spilled fecal juice all over the bathroom. I used a third roll of toilet paper to try to clean up before giving up. I tied my jacket around my waist to hide the brown stain on the back of my pants and made a hasty yet stealthy retreat, leaving a bathroom ruined with the worst diarrhea in human history in my wake. Thank you for the opportunity to share, and please, share your own stories about fecal distress with others on every story about kim you see so that others can know our struggle.","message_id":"b8caf066-7e3d-4b26-8f94-ad6057995a50","context_id":"deb2c740-79f4-37f4-a1bf-7a0fcff1825f","upvotes":37,"downvotes":17,"reports":1,"replies":19,"author_name":"UNCLE SAM","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/f61e85fc3b91ecc77907a53279706fe3_192.jpeg","author_guid":"6J3LCBWJ37AHSQZ674FYHMCHC4","score":0.61143210505139,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-78bf6652-7431-11e5-8af2-fa163e6f4a7e_c-deb2c740-79f4-37f4-a1bf-7a0fcff1825f_a-deb2c740-79f4-37f4-a1bf-7a0fcff1825f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/north-korea\/v-78bf6652-7431-11e5-8af2-fa163e6f4a7e_c-deb2c740-79f4-37f4-a1bf-7a0fcff1825f_a-deb2c740-79f4-37f4-a1bf-7a0fcff1825f","author":"Yahoo News","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/kim-jong-un-controls-north-211959993.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/32e1802c9cc4e65eb07b9d079c0d1fcf","title":"Kim Jong Un Controls North Korea Through Brutal Prison Network Where His Victims Starve to Death","summary":"Unlike political prisoners, who are held for life, people sent to \"reeducation\" camps are typically released and actually go through a process that at least attempts to resemble a semblance of a normal judicial process. \"Behavior that is normal anywhere in the world is criminalized in North Korea,\"\u00a0Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of HRNK, told Newsweek.

vs Lions: Thursday injury report all bad news for Pittsburgh","summary":"Thursday didn't show a lot of changes to the injury report for the Pittsburgh Steelers in the positive. According to the team, there's a good chance multiple starters won't be playing when the Steelers take on the Detroit Lions Sunday.

Citing its sources within North Korea, the Seoul-based Daily NK news web site said police \"have been mobilised for night patrols\" around statues dedicated to the three generations of the Kim family that have ruled the nation since 1945, while additional care is being taken across the country to protect wall murals and oil paintings in public places that extol their heroic achievements. Guards are traditionally assigned to statues and other landmarks designed to unite the North Korean people behind their leadership on national holidays and anniversaries linked to the Kim family, but that protection is being stepped up. \"Agencies have constantly been saying 'Use lights to illuminate statues and paintings of the three generals of the Mount Paekyu bloodline [the Kim dynasty] and thoroughly care for them to ensure that hostile elements cannot damage them',\"\u00a0a source in Pyongyang told the dissident publication. \"There have been reports of incidents targeting these statues and monuments to the Kim family, particularly in the more remote areas of the country,\"\u00a0said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korea's ruling family. Statues of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il Credit: REUTERS\u00a0 \"And, in comparison with the past, these incidents are becoming more frequent,\"\u00a0he told The Telegraph. \"Younger generations of North Koreans have little respect for Kim Jong-un and we are beginning to see that come to the surface,\" he said. People want food and better living standards; they do not care about nuclear weapons and missiles and they are asking why so much is being spent on them when they are hungry \"And local authorities have no choice but to increase security around these monuments because it could cost them their jobs - or worse - if such protests begin to spread.\"\u00a0 Discontent with the regime may well increase in the coming months, after North Korea suffered a severe drought at the beginning of its crop growing season, which will inevitably have an impact on the harvest. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has already warned of \"a sharp increase of food insecurity levels\" and other agencies have warned of widespread hunger among the population. Pyongyang has also requested assistance from the UN to feed its people, a step it has not had to take for several years. \"Despite all his promises, Kim Jong-un has had no significant successes and the people know it,\"\u00a0Professor Shigemura said. \"People want food and better living standards; they do not care about nuclear weapons and missiles and they are asking why so much is being spent on them when they are hungry.\"","published_at":1509010616,"content_id":"7aadadce-be87-33bd-b46f-7c4a00d6948b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/north-korea-steps-security-around-093656054.html","content_published_at":1509010616,"content_relative_time":30,"vibe_name":"@Megastream","vibe_id":"@MEGASTREAM"},"created_at":1509026284,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":false},{"text":"I am pretty sure someone has been blaming these earthquakes, volcanos and hurricanes on climate change.
