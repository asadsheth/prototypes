Chhabria, appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, wrote that although the case appeared to be a close call, \"it appears initially that the Trump administration has the stronger legal argument.\" The Trump administration this month terminated the payments to the insurers, which help cover medical expenses for low-income Americans, as part of several moves to dismantle Obama's signature healthcare law formally known as the Affordable Care Act.","published_at":1508975124,"content_id":"6719d846-734d-310d-bf12-e7090ea96abf","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/judge-rejects-bid-18-u-states-revive-obamacare-203900092--sector.html","content_published_at":1508975124,"content_relative_time":16,"vibe_name":"U.S. News","vibe_id":"ecd5e8af-dc90-3332-9efb-d522bf6b8dfa"},"created_at":1508979028,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"Actually, they argued that it was NOT a tax, but the Supreme Court ruled it WAS, which was the only reason they declared it legal.
