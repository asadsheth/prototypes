Banks and building societies over the past number of years have been allowed and continually allowed to cancel good savings schemes for worst ones. Much the same that the Government is also allowing companies to remove good pensions schemes for worst ones, then the government complains that people are not saving enough, that debt is rising. What do they expect when they allow institutions that allow the public to save a decent amount of money, remove those schemes in favour of ones that are worst for the public but better for the institution. House prices continue to rise but people can't afford mortgages. Good pension schemes and saving schemes are being persistently removed meaning people are having to put in more of their wages to get less at the end. The cost of living keep's increasing. People do not have enough money to put away to top up bad pension and saving schemes. Less money means people are forced to look elsewhere for cheaper goods which usually means online. This has a knock-on effect for the high street shops. Wages are kept low so businesses can maintain their profits. Also this going on under the governments watchful eye and all they are prepared to do is help foreign wealth into this country rather than help the actual citizens of this country. The poor get poorer while the rich get richer. The banking bubble burst and we had the banking crisis.

So effectively if you save \u00a3100 per month for a year at 3% you have invested \u00a31200 in over a year but you will only get about 1.5% on \u00a31200 because it hasn't all been in there for a year. So it is about the same as 1.5% in a savings account as a lump sum. It's a clever marketing ploy that fools the dumb.","message_id":"6d635ec5-1565-49f7-a131-2be8595d6113","context_id":"fc329dc9-0b2c-3597-bbf2-b1aa71c4e22c","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"D1500","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_mr.jpg","author_guid":"PCBIA3IKXNNRXAVDYK7TQTAFOA","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-b691105c-e6f7-312e-a0d0-6cb1f471486a_a-fc329dc9-0b2c-3597-bbf2-b1aa71c4e22c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/personal-finance\/yorkshire-building-society-closes-thousands-5vtaswo","author":"third_watch","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.finance.yahoo.com\/news\/yorkshire-building-society-closes-thousands-084523616.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/19edfe9e50bd3a2f5afdd659e70f3dd3","title":"Yorkshire Building Society closes thousands of accounts paying 3.55pc\u00a0","summary":"Yorkshire Building Society closes thousands of accounts paying 3.55pc\u00a0","published_at":1508316323,"content_id":"fc329dc9-0b2c-3597-bbf2-b1aa71c4e22c","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.finance.yahoo.com\/news\/yorkshire-building-society-closes-thousands-084523616.html","content_published_at":1508316323,"content_relative_time":38,"vibe_name":"Personal Finance","vibe_id":"da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223"},"created_at":1508428151,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":false},{"text":"Savers are a dying breed, so borrowers will get buried in rising debt it seems.","message_id":"8e392e93-2ea6-4c44-be74-58b2c97be31b","context_id":"fc329dc9-0b2c-3597-bbf2-b1aa71c4e22c","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"archie","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_A_mr.jpg","author_guid":"X36IBY5CROARYYYBMSG26XMLGM","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223_c-b691105c-e6f7-312e-a0d0-6cb1f471486a_a-fc329dc9-0b2c-3597-bbf2-b1aa71c4e22c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/personal-finance\/yorkshire-building-society-closes-thousands-5vtaswo","author":"third_watch","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.finance.yahoo.com\/news\/yorkshire-building-society-closes-thousands-084523616.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_818\/19edfe9e50bd3a2f5afdd659e70f3dd3","title":"Yorkshire Building Society closes thousands of accounts paying 3.55pc\u00a0","summary":"Yorkshire Building Society closes thousands of accounts paying 3.55pc\u00a0","published_at":1508316323,"content_id":"fc329dc9-0b2c-3597-bbf2-b1aa71c4e22c","content_url":"https:\/\/uk.finance.yahoo.com\/news\/yorkshire-building-society-closes-thousands-084523616.html","content_published_at":1508316323,"content_relative_time":38,"vibe_name":"Personal Finance","vibe_id":"da8561ef-8822-31d3-9509-283a3d2b5223"},"created_at":1508432343,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":false},{"text":"One of the reasons for maintaining low interest rates is to get you to spend your money before it loses value through inflation.

The answer may surprise you because it depends on you, what your goals are, and if it's the best rewards credit card. The answer also rests on how many 'bad interest payments' are made and the costs associated with it on your rewards credit card. More important than miles and points is being financially responsible. It's important to protect your credit score so you can save money on future loan or credit card applications. A general rule is to never or rarely make a late payment so you don't have to pay interest on a rewards credit card.
