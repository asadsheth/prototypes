In December, a group called Black in AI plans to host an afternoon workshop\u00a0to highlight AI research by\u00a0black computer scientists at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, one of the top gatherings for scientists working on AI. While the organizers invited people of all races to attend the workshop, they said only black researchers would be allowed to present papers. The debate echoes the\u00a0controversy in August that\u00a0followed Google employee James Damore's circulation of a manifesto that, among other points, accused\u00a0the company of overzealously promoting diversity at the expense of technical ability in hiring and promotions.","published_at":1508519501,"content_id":"adb50eaf-9ceb-30e6-b709-acb862d109a8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-10-20\/black-ai-workshop-becomes-latest-flashpoint-in-tech-s-culture-war?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=bd&utm_campaign=headline&cmpId=yhoo.headline&yptr=yahoo","content_published_at":1508518426,"content_relative_time":132,"vibe_name":"Artificial Intelligence","vibe_id":"106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe"},{"post_id":"v-106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe_c-b0a80bdf-c9ed-3f21-ba74-734bbc5be35e_a-b64a2ade-cdea-30f1-b5bc-67393f8d1f15","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/artificial-intelligence\/acuityads-cto-dr-nathan-mekuz-1txbpq3","author":"nanook","provider":"CNW Group","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/acuityads-cto-dr-nathan-mekuz-120000029.html","img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/Finance\/US_AFTP_CNWGROUP_CCM_LIVE\/rt.gifNewsItemIdC6474Transmission_Id201710200800CANADANWCANADAPR_C6474DateId20171020","title":"AcuityAds' CTO, Dr. Nathan Mekuz to Present at StableView TECH17","summary":"AcuityAds' CTO, Dr. Nathan Mekuz to Present at StableView TECH17","published_at":1508500911,"content_id":"b64a2ade-cdea-30f1-b5bc-67393f8d1f15","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/acuityads-cto-dr-nathan-mekuz-120000029.html","content_published_at":1508500800,"content_relative_time":137,"vibe_name":"Artificial Intelligence","vibe_id":"106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe"},{"post_id":"v-106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe_c-b211c255-0993-3513-a1af-3d27cf1ba956_a-24f47eec-f742-32bd-bab5-5de8041022b6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/artificial-intelligence\/cerberus-capital-management-appoints-afsheen-5lu60bm","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"PR Newswire","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/cerberus-capital-management-appoints-afsheen-110000063.html","img":null,"title":"Cerberus Capital Management Appoints Afsheen Afshar as Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer","summary":"NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2017 \/PRNewswire\/ --\u00a0Cerberus Capital Management, L.P.
