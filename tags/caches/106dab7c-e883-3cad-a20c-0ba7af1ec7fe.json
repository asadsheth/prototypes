If we\u2019ve given it common sense, it might ask us: \u201cHow many paperclips do you want?\u201d If it doesn\u2019t know to ask, it might just make paperclips forever.","published_at":1507722924,"content_id":"8053dd41-5823-39b9-861f-883142233397","content_url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/tldr\/2017\/10\/11\/16457742\/ai-paperclips-thought-experiment-game-frank-lantz?yptr=yahoo","content_published_at":1507722027,"content_relative_time":7,"vibe_name":"Artificial Intelligence"},{"post_id":"v-106dab7c-e883-3cad-a20c-0ba7af1ec7fe_c-b81c2b0c-cdbc-3df2-be53-11448c1a3492_a-19772703-05e7-3975-aba8-958b02dd2589","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/artificial-intelligence\/artificial-intelligence-fuelling-customer-experience-55qo3e6","author":"nanook","provider":"PR Newswire","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/artificial-intelligence-fuelling-customer-experience-230500903.html","img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/Finance\/US_AFTP_PRNEWSWIRE_LIVE\/Artificial_Intelligence_is_Fuelling_the-93c1be940fafad7473873ec378e8136b","title":"Artificial Intelligence is Fuelling the Customer Experience Strategies of the World's Top Brands Today","summary":"HONG KONG, Oct. 11, 2017 \/PRNewswire\/ -- A global survey of more than 550 senior executives across 30 countries and territories reports that 91 percent of \"iconic\" companies\u00a0-- \u00a0those that maintain both the highest levels of customer experience (CX) satisfaction and have world-leading brand recognition\u00a0-- deploy Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions to increase customer satisfaction, compared to 42 percent of companies in their fields overall.
