Even more shocking, director Berg was quoted as saying that she could not find any company willing to distribute her film\n\n. It includes interviews with victims and identifies by name those who have been caught, prosecuted and convicted for sexual abuse. The film identifies a pedophile ring once led by a convicted sex offender named Marc Collins-Rector, who had ties to the rich and famous in Hollywood. There is no doubt that Hollywood is an industry dominated by homosexuals, some of whom don\u2019t want this film to be seen by the American people.\n\n The claim that the film is not about homosexuality, but rather pedophilia and child abuse, is strictly true. However, all of the cases described in the film involve adult males molesting boys. What\u2019s more, the founder of the modern gay rights movement, Harry Hay, was a supporter of the North American Man-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA).

Michael Zaydel had promised to give himself up to police if a Facebook post about an existing arrest warrant received more than 1,000 shares. The cocky 21-year-old even promised to bring Redford Township Police Department (RTPD) officers a dozen doughnuts if they were victorious in the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf your next post gets 1,000 shares I\u2019ll turn myself in with a dozen doughnuts and that\u2019s a promise. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll pick up every piece of litter around your public schools.\u201d In a follow-up post, the department said he \u201cmay or may not be a man of his word,\u201d adding, \u201cit is our experience everyone gets caught at some point.

Michael Zaydel had promised to give himself up to police if a Facebook post about an existing arrest warrant received more than 1,000 shares. The cocky 21-year-old even promised to bring Redford Township Police Department (RTPD) officers a dozen doughnuts if they were victorious in the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf your next post gets 1,000 shares I\u2019ll turn myself in with a dozen doughnuts and that\u2019s a promise. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll pick up every piece of litter around your public schools.\u201d In a follow-up post, the department said he \u201cmay or may not be a man of his word,\u201d adding, \u201cit is our experience everyone gets caught at some point.

He has drawn a lot of attention to himself, and that makes it hard to hide from reality.\u201d The fugitive eventually surrendered to police, fulfilling his promise by arriving at the station with doughnuts and a bagel. \u201cZaydel made good on his promise to turn himself in to RTPD for his outstanding warrants,\u201d the department said. \u201cHe walked in on his own, and not only did he bring the doughnuts, he brought one bagel!

District attorneys in Harris County, which includes Houston, and neighboring Montgomery County, requested the stay to examine Shore's claim that another death row inmate tried to persuade him to take the blame for a murder for which the other inmate had been convicted.","published_at":1508321323,"content_id":"d2e2265d-db8e-3713-b062-a7a25e65205f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/texas-execute-tourniquet-killer-serial-rape-murder-100807977.html","content_published_at":1508365629,"content_relative_time":24,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture","vibe_id":"5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c"},"created_at":1508327977,"comment_relative_time":35,"bot":false},{"text":"boy needs to learn about truth in jail","message_id":"42e0f6bd-7f41-42c7-a8b5-304dbd906290","context_id":"f7da3ab1-bf31-3a62-b7a2-1772ebadf6af","upvotes":16,"downvotes":7,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"BERIBERIGOOD","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_jl.jpg","author_guid":"MKPOCEZO7HW7CHBVIYRXTPT6ZA","score":0.68402377050112,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-063e9364-9b95-3545-b7c0-b28a310230ef_a-f7da3ab1-bf31-3a62-b7a2-1772ebadf6af","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/wanted-man-turns-himself-losing-3rdjon9","author":"third_watch","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/wanted-man-turns-himself-losing-100133403.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/a456a2652674854a37941f6be441acba","title":"Wanted man turns himself in after losing Facebook bet with police \u00a0","summary":"A wanted Michigan man has turned himself in after losing a bet he made with police on Facebook.

Michael Zaydel had promised to give himself up to police if a Facebook post about an existing arrest warrant received more than 1,000 shares. The cocky 21-year-old even promised to bring Redford Township Police Department (RTPD) officers a dozen doughnuts if they were victorious in the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf your next post gets 1,000 shares I\u2019ll turn myself in with a dozen doughnuts and that\u2019s a promise. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll pick up every piece of litter around your public schools.\u201d In a follow-up post, the department said he \u201cmay or may not be a man of his word,\u201d adding, \u201cit is our experience everyone gets caught at some point. He has drawn a lot of attention to himself, and that makes it hard to hide from reality.\u201d The fugitive eventually surrendered to police, fulfilling his promise by arriving at the station with doughnuts and a bagel. \u201cZaydel made good on his promise to turn himself in to RTPD for his outstanding warrants,\u201d the department said. \u201cHe walked in on his own, and not only did he bring the doughnuts, he brought one bagel! We would again like to express our gratitude for the support of all who followed this, shared it, and left us positive feedback.\u201d Mr Zaydel was sentenced to 39 days in jail after pleading guilty to breaking the terms of his probation.

Michael Zaydel had promised to give himself up to police if a Facebook post about an existing arrest warrant received more than 1,000 shares. The cocky 21-year-old even promised to bring Redford Township Police Department (RTPD) officers a dozen doughnuts if they were victorious in the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf your next post gets 1,000 shares I\u2019ll turn myself in with a dozen doughnuts and that\u2019s a promise. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll pick up every piece of litter around your public schools.\u201d In a follow-up post, the department said he \u201cmay or may not be a man of his word,\u201d adding, \u201cit is our experience everyone gets caught at some point. He has drawn a lot of attention to himself, and that makes it hard to hide from reality.\u201d The fugitive eventually surrendered to police, fulfilling his promise by arriving at the station with doughnuts and a bagel. \u201cZaydel made good on his promise to turn himself in to RTPD for his outstanding warrants,\u201d the department said. \u201cHe walked in on his own, and not only did he bring the doughnuts, he brought one bagel! We would again like to express our gratitude for the support of all who followed this, shared it, and left us positive feedback.\u201d Mr Zaydel was sentenced to 39 days in jail after pleading guilty to breaking the terms of his probation.
