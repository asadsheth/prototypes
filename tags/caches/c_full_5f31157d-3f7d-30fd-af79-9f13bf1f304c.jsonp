I have a family member who at around 7-8 years old we all kinda knew something was different. He played with dolls , did his hair up like a girl sometimes, loved to do hair and nails , etc.  The signs were there. Obviously at that age it's not a sexual thing but from observing this close relative , being gay wasn't just a sexual experience. \n\nHe was the only one in our large family who was gay. I can 100% say he did not choose to be that way no more than he chose the color of skin he was born with. He was kinda miserable as a teenager because he was told to be someone he wasn't. He even dated girls but after a few weeks they knew. \n\nHe's in his 40s now and is marrying his long time partner and he's very happy and does very well for himself. \n\nAgain , he did not choose it. He was born that way. So he was gay much earlier than 7 years old .

Also, initial stories suggested the teens were blocking the road, and 2 of the teens in the group threw their drinks at the perpetrator's car, inciting his reaction.  Again, if these kids had an adult with them, especially two or three adults to drive them back to the mosque, this tragedy would likely never have happened.  Nabra did not deserve this, but by the same token, no one should feel entitled to be able to go roaming around at 3am and throw drinks at someone's car without risking problems.
