They have their \"Firefighter 1\" and already know many of the procedures and CDF knows them.","message_id":"7de29e00-94bd-4d79-b765-237ee8fb67ce","context_id":"204ddb09-b1cc-384e-8b8a-2fa34e6a87bd","upvotes":180,"downvotes":6,"reports":1,"replies":9,"author_name":"Susan","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_S_jd_2_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"EIDEV4OXKJSNLT5HFZONSQ5DU4","score":0.92003998203962,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-f1e0179d-2059-3e2a-a799-64c10825930e_a-204ddb09-b1cc-384e-8b8a-2fa34e6a87bd","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/california-inmates-fight-wildfires-buck-hour-1yfi7mq","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"AFP","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/california-inmates-fight-wildfires-buck-hour-013527628.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/afp.com\/403361e41eb1dccb8c83b921a9aa5c1301e077a2.jpg","title":"California inmates fight wildfires for a buck an hour","summary":"Fresh out of prison, Alejandro Rangel longs to keep doing the job he did as an inmate for one dollar an hour: fight forest fires.

Here, however, there are allegations that Weinstein settled 8 potential law suits by paying his accusers large amounts of money.  Assuming that is true, that would give anyone more than enough basis to conclude that Weinstein was guilty of sexual misconduct, be it harassment, abuse, sexual assault, or all of the above.  As to Stone's statement that \"it's not easy what he's going through,\"  that is true of anyone accused of misconduct, civil or criminal.  That's an inevitable part of the legal system, someone gets accused or sued and if the case proceeds to trial, the accuser must have evidence to prove the allegations and the person accused has the right but also the burden of defending himself or herself.  Assuming Weinstein has settled numerous cases involving misconduct, including possibly sexual assault, why would Stone make a point of expressing sympathy for him?  It's enough to remind people that as to possible criminal charges, he is presumed innocent. That doesn't mean anyone should feel sorry for him whatsoever.  At least as to the statement reported on, Stone expresses no sympathy whatsoever for the victims.  Further, he seems to present some sort of defense of Weinstein's conduct on the grounds that is it pervasive in Hollywood.  Well, that's precisely why this is an important matter.  An institution like Hollywood, that plays such an influential role in defining our culture, has an enormous responsibility to society not to transmit the cynicism which Weinstein's behavior represents.  I for one don't believe that a corrupt person or a corrupt institution can, in the long run, communicate positive human values. Hypocrisy rots the soul.","message_id":"bb8183f5-0b5d-4deb-af53-e4d82059ded0","context_id":"0d3579f5-65f4-3058-80ba-0e2d12c4e01e","upvotes":4,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Liz","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_L_jd_3_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"KXIHBEWUETAI5X2Z2CXW243QVM","score":0.64841045908534,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-e734e2c3-1ed5-35e6-8167-9c94c977c434_a-0d3579f5-65f4-3058-80ba-0e2d12c4e01e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/oliver-stone-harvey-weinstein-not-7cxw7j5","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Deadline","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/oliver-stone-harvey-weinstein-not-015846358.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/0b892ef1d93e01cd38c404dfb32d7a7e","title":"Oliver Stone on Harvey Weinstein: \u201cIt\u2019s Not Easy What He\u2019s Going Through\u201d","summary":"Director Oliver Stone has condemned a rush to judgment on producer Harvey Weinstein and the allegations by many women of sexual harassment, charges that led to Weinstein being fired from the company that bears his name.

And even though some may find these truths from God's Word painful, we must be honest enough to accept them as His revealed will. Now let's discover what Jesus' nine points are:\n\nA. The \"little horn\" or kingdom \"came up among them\"the 10 horns which were the kingdoms of Western Europe (Daniel 7:8). So it would be a little kingdom somewhere in Western Europe.\n\nB. It would have a man at its head who could speak for it (Daniel 7:8).\n\nC. It would pluck up or uproot three kingdoms (Daniel 7:8).\n\nD. It would be \"diverse\" or different from the other 10 kingdoms (Daniel 7:24).\n\nE. It would make war with and \"wear out\" or persecute the saints (Daniel 7:21, 25).\n\nF. It would emerge from the pagan Roman empire, the fourth world kingdom (Daniel 7:7, 8).\n\nG. God's people (the saints) would \"be given into his hand\" for \"a time and times and the dividing of time\" (Daniel 7:25).\n\nH. It would \"speak great words against\" or blaspheme God (Daniel 7:25). In Revelation 13:5, the Bible says the same power speaks \"great things and blasphemies.\"\n\nI. It would \"think to change times and laws.\" Daniel 7:25.\n\nDon't forget all these identification points come directly from the Bible. They are not some human opinion or speculation. Historians could tell you quickly what power is being described. These points can fit only one power, the papacy.","message_id":"41460ed8-e162-4c78-a06c-eb65296aaddb","context_id":"fed10443-ccb9-3fb5-a328-f6423cf949b1","upvotes":3,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"Susanna LIVES","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/7808f6586ee55fa61de5c47c77a8d30f_192.png","author_guid":"AHBLTYJ3ZEHKWNV25QDLICW2T4","score":0.50262829476031,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-efd2a513-634b-3d93-a850-14c5387c9085_a-fed10443-ccb9-3fb5-a328-f6423cf949b1","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/pope-death-penalty-20wkpku","author":"third_watch","provider":"Time Magazine Videos","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/pope-death-penalty-070013002.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/video\/video.timevideos.com\/4c6514f1cf4b1e52c70083c039e67975","title":"Pope Francis Wants the Catholic Church to Change Doctrine on Death Penalty","summary":null,"published_at":1507907963,"content_id":"fed10443-ccb9-3fb5-a328-f6423cf949b1","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/pope-death-penalty-070013002.html","content_published_at":1507878013,"content_relative_time":16,"vibe_name":"Society & Culture","vibe_id":"5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c"},"created_at":1507904705,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":false},{"text":"I'm guessing that there will be a \"slight\" price increase in marijuana.","message_id":"3f134f4c-54be-4318-940b-e060b1e7d57c","context_id":"d8f5d252-43ce-316c-beff-43b92a8b2342","upvotes":2,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Zeek","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_Z_ald_2_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"F3VTFNDDJ5CVWSYLU4EU4PJUSA","score":0.47629367141096,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-d9249403-cbbf-333b-ad83-182e63318177_a-d8f5d252-43ce-316c-beff-43b92a8b2342","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/society-culture\/v-5f31157d-3f7d-30fd-af79-9f13bf1f304c_c-d9249403-cbbf-333b-ad83-182e63318177_a-d8f5d252-43ce-316c-beff-43b92a8b2342","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/california-fires-destroying-marijuana-farms-154932812.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/c57d710d59808e8cef091b14cb7bff8e","title":"California Fires Are Destroying Marijuana Farms","summary":"First the wildfires in Northern California came for your wine.
