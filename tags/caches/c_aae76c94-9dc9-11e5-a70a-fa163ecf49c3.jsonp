Although it can be argued that there is a lack of elite talent compared to some of the players who could hit the market in the coming years, there are enough difference-makers out there who could change the MLB landscape depending upon where they decide to sign. With the offseason quickly approaching, here is a look at the latest rumors surrounding some underrated players with the potential to provide some big-time value. It may seem odd to characterize a four-time All-Star as underrated, but outfielder Justin Upton has often fallen a bit short of his immense potential over the course of his career.","published_at":1507681602,"content_id":"7deefcd6-774e-3562-a65d-937e64ab405a","content_url":"http:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/articles\/2737906-2017-mlb-free-agents-rumors-and-predictions-for-underrated-assets","content_published_at":1507652496,"content_relative_time":47,"vibe_name":"MLB"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":47,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-3aa26663-5c21-38b4-a372-10fc12d3bde5_a-6065bdf1-36ad-38d4-b689-c01ed179c3c7","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/cleveland-indians-terry-francona-says-1kefte1","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"cleveland.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.cleveland.com\/tribe\/index.ssf\/2017\/10\/cleveland_indians_terry_franco_69.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/O_2VJ2gNQfvTsnmQFzV0KA--\/dz02MjA7aD00MjM7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_6065bdf1-36ad-38d4-b689-c01ed179c3c7--1414661665.jpeg","title":"Cleveland Indians' Terry Francona says Edwin Encarnacion could play in ALDS Game 5","summary":"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Manager Terry Francona said DH Edwin Encarnacion could return to the Indians' starting lineup Wednesday night for a decisive Game 5 of the ALDS at Progressive Field.

Tanner Roark was scheduled to start against in Game 4 on Tuesday, but the game was rained out and rescheduled for Wednesday. That gave Strasburg an extra day of rest; Strasburg last pitched on Friday, so he would have been pitching on four days' rest. Nationals manager Dusty Baker announced that Roark would start on Wednesday in a press conference shortly after the game was officially postponed. Baker initially said that Strasburg threw a bullpen session on Tuesday, which would have rendered him unable to pitch on Wednesday, but the team later said Baker misspoke and that Strasburg threw the session on Monday. Baker also said that Strasburg is feeling under the weather, as are a number of his teammates. Baker hypothesized that the cause of the sudden sicknesses were the change of weather, air conditioning in the hotel and\/or mold in the city of Chicago. Strasburg threw a gem in Game 1 of the series, surrendering just three hits and one earned run over seven inning. First pitch of Game 4 will be at 4:08 p.m. EST on Wednesday.","published_at":1507405559,"content_id":"11788e52-0301-3d46-928a-b3efa9c3ed61","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/report-stephen-strasburg-apos-declines-001149850.html","content_published_at":1507680709,"content_relative_time":39,"vibe_name":"MLB"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":39,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-8ce3320a-4ed2-3ef9-a262-73512539396c_a-8970170b-1702-3108-99df-84cd5ee7de6f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/shohei-otani-surgery-ankle-thursday-14440bj","author":"captainunderoos","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/shohei-otani-surgery-ankle-thursday-115137577.html","img":null,"title":"Shohei Otani to have surgery on right ankle on Thursday","summary":"TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japanese baseball player Shohei Otani will have right ankle surgery on Thursday.","published_at":1507722850,"content_id":"8970170b-1702-3108-99df-84cd5ee7de6f","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/shohei-otani-surgery-ankle-thursday-115137577.html","content_published_at":1507722697,"content_relative_time":27,"vibe_name":"MLB"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-0e129894-51f0-3a03-8ed1-9e35ddc1fb1f_a-f55306d9-13b1-35f2-a086-8570e8ef93d4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/nats-cubs-game-4-delayed-5r49wy9","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"ESPN.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/mlb\/story\/_\/id\/20982955\/2017-mlb-postseason-washington-nationals-chicago-cubs-game-4-delayed","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/z19.TDsFNb0Ik_gfWnut3g--\/dz0xMjk2O2g9NzI5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_f55306d9-13b1-35f2-a086-8570e8ef93d4--2034105081.jpeg","title":"Nats stick with Roark after Game 4 ppd. to Wed.","summary":"Eddie Matz covers the Washington Nationals and the world of Major League Baseball for ESPN.com.
