jsonp_parse_posts([{"text":"well Mr Walters you are flawed in your conclusion. The umpire has gone on record saying \"in his judgement\" the bat hitting Wieters helmet had no bearing on the play; the rule you quoted clearly states \"in the judgement of the umpire\" meaning it is at the sole discretion of the umpire to determine if in fact he felt the unintentional act caused Wieters to miss the ball or hindered him in making a play.....which it clearly did not....and that \"judgement of the umpire\" is what makes it not review-able. the umpire did NOT miss the bat hitting the catcher he stated he clearly saw it hit the catcher and in \"his judgement\" it had zero bearing on the play. As a side note Wieters is known for lunging forward for pitches and interfering quite often on batters (he was called for it ironically later in this very game) not that this has any bearing on this play but a catcher encroaching a batter is more likely to get hit on a backswing.. the play at first is review-able sine there are so many different angles that logically the ump can't see (by the way i don't like replay for this slight loss of contact with base) which again makes it a review-able play that can be challenged resorting to technology making the final call. In closing I can only assume you are a butthurt Nats fan......and remember.....GO CUBS!!!!!","message_id":"2756307c-03da-432a-8bac-e93eeb10b600","context_id":"17a1ec20-c91d-3290-94b9-149377d8a30d","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"bob","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_jl.jpg","author_guid":"KIVNIS7QMURFCXPLT5HKUFJF2E","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-3cf7172f-bf99-3f69-bcbe-454ec12812a7_a-17a1ec20-c91d-3290-94b9-149377d8a30d","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/baseball-instant-replay-needs-thrown-10ahqx8","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/baseball-instant-replay-needs-thrown-164746265.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/newsweek.com\/f4a838638fce8c9982c203914f0456f4","title":"Baseball\u2019s Instant Replay Needs to Be Thrown Out","summary":"Not even cameras are able to eliminate human imperfections from sports.","published_at":1507931355,"content_id":"17a1ec20-c91d-3290-94b9-149377d8a30d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/baseball-instant-replay-needs-thrown-164746265.html","content_published_at":1507913266,"content_relative_time":6,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3"},"created_at":1507934614,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"\"And the Nationals totally got screwed by replay.\"  the runner was out which was proven by replay. they didn't get screwed by replay.  replay was put in because whinny sports reporters kept demanding it, and now are complaining about it.
