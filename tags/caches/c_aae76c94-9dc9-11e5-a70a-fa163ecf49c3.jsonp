What\u2019s more, only eight teams are permitted more than one playoff game after the wild-card round concludes.SI Eats felt it was important to reward the remaining eight teams with a fresh take on our original list of the best and weirdest ballpark foods available this season. In June we provided an overview of each team\u2019s best and weirdest item. Now, we\u2019re raising the stakes: We\u2019re going to power rank them. (Don\u2019t @ us. Also, while there may not be any direct correlation between good food and good baseball, it is important to note that the bottom two on our \u2018Best\u2019 rankings are facing significant division series deficits\u2026) The best food available in the playoffs 1. Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl original half smoke (Nationals)The Nats could be down to their final game at Nationals Park this season, so if you\u2019re there, you best be ordering the chili. It\u2019s top-notch, and it only gets better when complemented by cheese and onions on top of a smoked half-pork, half-beef sausage. Round it out with an order of fries, and get set to enjoy the best ballpark meal you\u2019ll have in October. 2. Elote (Dodgers)Corn on the cob is already delicious with a little melted butter brushed across it. The flavor only improves when you dress it up a bit like the Dodgers do. Elote is caked with cotija cheese and chili powder, which sticks to the cob after spreading around a bit of mayonnaise. The flavors sound like they might be all over the place, but I promise it\u2019s an item you won\u2019t regret trying. 3. Lobster roll (Red Sox)There\u2019s not much of a justification needed here. It\u2019s a lobster roll from New England. It\u2019s going to be good. (And likely more expensive than any other food option at Fenway.) 4. Chorizo Loaded Fries (Astros)Houston pulled off a stellar Tex-Mex option here. It\u2019s hard to find flaws in a bed of fries topped with chorizo, chipotle mayo, queso and green onions. Unfortunately you might need a fork for this one. 5. Chicago-style hot dog (Cubs)Nothing special to see here from the Cubs, they\u2019re just fulfilling their obligation as residents of Chicago. It\u2019s a lot to stuff in a hot dog\u2014relish, onions, tomatoes, mustard, celery salt and a dill pickle in a poppy seed bun\u2014but that\u2019s the way it\u2019s done. 6. Melt Parmageddon (Indians)This might fit better on the weirdest food list, but it won USA Today\u2019s Best Ballpark Food of 2016 fan vote. Here\u2019s our description of it from earlier this year, and you can make the call: \u201cIt\u2019s a Great Lakes twist on grilled cheese, with a potato and onion pierogi, onions and sauerkraut between two pieces of bread and some cheddar.\u201d 7. D-bat Dog (Diamondbacks)Is anyone ever ready to demolish an 18-inch corn dog stuffed with jalape\u00f1o, cheddar cheese and bacon? Don\u2019t worry, it also comes with fries. The D-backs get points for selling an entree that should be enough for two people, but it\u2019s also a stuffed corn dog. 8. Lobel\u2019s Meatload Burger (Yankees)Admittedly I\u2019m not a meatloaf fan, so the Yankees\u2019 \u201cbest\u201d item was already at a disadvantage. It might taste OK, but I\u2019m infinitely more likely to order The Grub Tub (a large plastic cup that includes a bowl near the top to hold chicken tenders and fries). That\u2019s the Yankees\u2019 true prized concession. Weirdest food available in the playoffs 1. Killer Kilbane Dog (Indians)There are bizarre food combinations that are strategic and could work together, and then there\u2019s random concoctions made for Instagram more than consumption. This is the latter. It\u2019s a hot dog with relish, peanut butter!?? and sriracha. Hopefully you\u2019re sitting near a bathroom. 2. Barnyard Wedding (Yankees)Like most of these options, this isn\u2019t for everyone. But there\u2019s definite potential in a burger topped with cheddar, fried chicken and a hashbrown. Might take two (or seven) people to conquer this beast. 3. Funnel Cake Chicken Sandwich (Diamondbacks)Sweet and salty mixtures usually work, so I can get behind fried chicken sandwiched between a sugary funnel cake. It starts to climb the weird food rankings when you consider the cheddar cheese and strawberry jam also added to the sandwich. 4. Dodger Burger (Dodgers)The classic question at most BBQs is \u201cburger or hot dog?\u201d The Dodgers answered \u201cboth.\u201d What\u2019s more, on top of the burger-hot dog sandwich is BBQ sauce, jalape\u00f1o poppers and caramelized onions. 5. Bourbon and cinnamon babka push pop (Nationals)Bourbon and cinnamon sounds like palatable option. It\u2019s slightly uncomfortable to imagine that flavor combination in a dessert usually enjoyed by kids. Still worth trying. 6. Lobster Poutine Steak (Red Sox)Not a ton of creativity points for the Red Sox here. Poutine is already good on its own, and trying to add some lobster and replace the gravy with bisque isn\u2019t as weird as it is wrong. 7. Chicken and Waffle Cone (Astros)The Astros took a page out of KFC\u2019s book with this concoction. It\u2019s a waffle cone that contains fried chicken, mashed potatoes and honey mustard, resembling KFC\u2019s Famous Bowl that mixes popcorn chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy and corn. Both are delicious. Both aren\u2019t that weird. 8. Pig Candy BLT (Cubs)This is the surest bet of anything on the list to taste great. That\u2019s why it ranks last on the list of weirdest food. It\u2019s a BLT with candied bacon and the other regular fixings on brioche bun. Honorable mentionSome teams are unveiling items solely for the postseason, so keep an eye out for these delectables. Carmel Cinnamon Roll Sundae (Diamondbacks) Fried Chicken and Ice Cream Sandwich (Dodgers)Fried chicken and ice cream together should probably not be allowed, but the playoffs are full of anxiety. Stress-eating takes on a whole new meaning.","published_at":1507573706,"content_id":"02a0b705-d932-3dce-bf41-2a5f14d1228e","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/ranking-best-weirdest-mlb-playoff-151427341.html","content_published_at":1507562067,"content_relative_time":6,"vibe_name":"MLB"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-6d599eaa-770b-3724-bbf3-b6b979a1b8b3_a-2d416a7c-1fb0-36bc-8f13-76f60670a026","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/josh-reddick-caused-3-run-4l7ruha","author":"third_watch","provider":"SB Nation","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.sbnation.com\/2017\/10\/8\/16445104\/red-sox-astros-alds-game-3-reddick-betts?yptr=yahoo","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/sbnation1.vox.com\/5f1b0fa75c0a5cc1c45fe2ead479bcdd","title":"Josh Reddick caused a 3-run homer innings after one was stolen away from him","summary":"Mookie Betts might be the best defensive right fielder in the American League, if not the majors.
