She taught Special Ed. It takes a special human being to do that. She went into the Drop program and worked an additional 4 years in the school system, but not in Special Ed too much. At 69 she had to retire, and at age 70 the symptoms started. About a year later the family decided it was best to put her in an assisted living home. The family had to transfer all her assets to her children. She received $3,400 a month in retirement which the Assisted Living Home took to take care of her. We were fortunate in that the home was just a quarter mile from my house and my wife is a registered nurse who was very close to her mom. She visited her everyday, sometimes twice in a day if she was off from work. This was good in many ways, including the fact that the home knew she was close by and could pop in any time. Over a 3 year period I watched my mother-in-law deteriorate, and I watched my wife in pain dealing with it, and all I could do was hug her and tell her I much I loved her. There were 6 other brothers and sisters and only one of the brothers really visited her often. I told my wife how she could hold her head up high and know in her heart that she took care of her mom. One day during her last year of life I went with my wife to visit her. She wasn't talking much then, but out of no where she looks at my wife from her bed and tells her with tears rolling down her face. \"You are a really good daughter. I had to leave the room because the tears were flowing, and because I knew that she knew her time on this earth was coming to an end. My wife was  with her when she passed at the young age of 74. I will always remember her as one of the best human beings I was lucky enough to have in my life. I just wish I would have told her so.","id":"1843a632-10ef-472b-9d90-eb2349e5b3f7","context_id":"bea67946-b583-3bf9-b17b-92279ce2f8b6","upvotes":31,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":4,"author_name":"Steve","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_S_kl.jpg","score":0.91929094303327,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-bfebc5e7-586f-3476-b78a-558b0bfc2f94_c-5dfb4dee-e8c2-326c-813e-5085561e02d0_a-bea67946-b583-3bf9-b17b-92279ce2f8b6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/listen-to-america\/apos-alzheimer-tsunami-alongside-medicaid-4r53y9z","author":"third_watch","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/apos-alzheimer-tsunami-alongside-medicaid-094622978.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/huffpost_fp_modules_949\/58498d57047f9f25de385d6e0343d30c","title":"'Alzheimer\u2019s Tsunami\u2019 Alongside Medicaid Cuts Leaves Dementia Patients With Vanishing Options","summary":"Several times a week, Lou Stepanek drives to the Hiawatha Care Center in Iowa to spend time with someone who hasn\u2019t seemed to recognize him for more than a decade: his wife.

This event occured circa 600 A.D, around 500 years after the Apostle John received his message of revelation from God himself (circa. 96 A.D. on the island of Patmos) to complete the New Testament canon which speaks of how Christ fulfilled the Law and the Prophets (i.e. the Old Testament prophecies) and that only through faith alone, in Christ alone can a person have eternal life. John completes the message of the New Testament (under the inspiration of God the Holy Spirit) by saying:\nRev 22:18-19  \"For I testify together to everyone who hears the Words of the prophecy of this Book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add on him the plagues that have been written in this Book. And if anyone takes away from the Words of the Book of this prophecy, God will take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which have been written in this Book. \"\nTherefore it must be concluded that the angel 'Gibreal' was not of God, but one of Satan's minions, posing 'as an angel of light' (2 Cor. 11:14).
