She taught Special Ed. It takes a special human being to do that. She went into the Drop program and worked an additional 4 years in the school system, but not in Special Ed too much. At 69 she had to retire, and at age 70 the symptoms started. About a year later the family decided it was best to put her in an assisted living home. The family had to transfer all her assets to her children. She received $3,400 a month in retirement which the Assisted Living Home took to take care of her. We were fortunate in that the home was just a quarter mile from my house and my wife is a registered nurse who was very close to her mom. She visited her everyday, sometimes twice in a day if she was off from work. This was good in many ways, including the fact that the home knew she was close by and could pop in any time. Over a 3 year period I watched my mother-in-law deteriorate, and I watched my wife in pain dealing with it, and all I could do was hug her and tell her I much I loved her. There were 6 other brothers and sisters and only one of the brothers really visited her often. I told my wife how she could hold her head up high and know in her heart that she took care of her mom. One day during her last year of life I went with my wife to visit her. She wasn't talking much then, but out of no where she looks at my wife from her bed and tells her with tears rolling down her face. \"You are a really good daughter. I had to leave the room because the tears were flowing, and because I knew that she knew her time on this earth was coming to an end. My wife was  with her when she passed at the young age of 74. I will always remember her as one of the best human beings I was lucky enough to have in my life. I just wish I would have told her so.","id":"1843a632-10ef-472b-9d90-eb2349e5b3f7","context_id":"bea67946-b583-3bf9-b17b-92279ce2f8b6","upvotes":31,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":4,"author_name":"Bill S","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_BS_kl.jpg","score":0.91929094303327,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-bfebc5e7-586f-3476-b78a-558b0bfc2f94_c-5dfb4dee-e8c2-326c-813e-5085561e02d0_a-bea67946-b583-3bf9-b17b-92279ce2f8b6","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/listen-to-america\/apos-alzheimer-tsunami-alongside-medicaid-4r53y9z","author":"third_watch","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/apos-alzheimer-tsunami-alongside-medicaid-094622978.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/huffpost_fp_modules_949\/58498d57047f9f25de385d6e0343d30c","title":"'Alzheimer\u2019s Tsunami\u2019 Alongside Medicaid Cuts Leaves Dementia Patients With Vanishing Options","summary":"Several times a week, Lou Stepanek drives to the Hiawatha Care Center in Iowa to spend time with someone who hasn\u2019t seemed to recognize him for more than a decade: his wife.

Although I may not agree with all your points, many hit home.  I'm a white male who was born and raised on the northwest side of Milwaukee.  I was very young when desegregation was introduced to Milwaukee Public Schools in the late 1970's.  I used to only look at this change from someone who was white. I was very fortunate to meet kids who were black that provided a different perspective.  I also agree that the manufacturing jobs that existed in the Milwaukee and paid a living wage have all but left the area. I recently visited the city after being away for 12 years, and couldn't believe the changes.  I was saddened by how some of my favorite places growing up (i.e. Northridge Mall) are completely gone.

Insisting they are compatable with us and our equal when they themselves know that is not true and do not want to live with themselves.\n   Whites have crossed seas, harnessed rivers, carved mountains, tamed deserts, and colonized the most barren ice fields. Whites have formed nations, built civilizations, and administrated power. Whites created automation, discovered electricity, nuclear energy, X-rays and invented automobiles, airplanes, jet engines, spacecraft, submarines, helicopters, radio, television, internet, computers, currency, telephones, and medicine. Whites unlocked the secrets of DNA, and relativity, launched communication satellites, invented microwave ovens, concrete, light bulbs, photography, telescopes and microscopes and countless other technological miracles. Whites were the first to circumnavigate the planet by ship, and orbit it by spacecraft, to walk on the moon and explore the solar system, climb the highest peak, reach both poles, exceed the sound barrier, descend to the deepest points of the oceans... \n\nyet Blacks still can't even feed themselves. No pre-contact sub-Saharan African society ever created a written language, or weaved cloth, or forged steel, or invented the wheel, or plow, or devised a calendar, or code of laws, or any social organization, or system of measurement, or math, or built a multi-story structure, or sewer, or infrastructure of any kind. They never drilled a well, or irrigated, or created any agriculture, or built a road, or sea-worthy vessel. They never domesticated animals, or exploited underground natural resources, or produced anything that could be considered a mechanical device. \n\nBlacks were still living in the Stone Age when Whites discovered them just 400 years ago. Today they seem unaware of how extremely privileged and fortunate they are to be allowed to live among us and enjoy everything WE have created in the last 10,000 years. A privilege that can and should be revoked. Their behavior cannot and will not be allowed to continue till the End of Days.

Until one of you minorities can actually stand up and tell the truth, you will drown in your lies and excuses.

Banks leave for the same reasons.  Machine shops close because they get broken into.  Whites have fled as they are TARGETS of racist blacks.  Neighborhoods decline because people don't mow their lawn and trim their bushes.  The inner cities of America have become blight because blacks push blight.  Democratic leaders of these cities spend BILLIONS on flipping choo choo trains rather than investing in our kids futures.  What with stolen car epidemic in Milwaukee and the fact that the north side is more dangerous than Bagdad is why you are where you are.

Decent law abiding citizens are moving away because they no longer feel safe here.  The downtown area has dried up and now looks dirty and ran down.  Our republican liberal Mayor Tom Barrett closes his eyes and makes excuses to what is happening to the city.  He is more concerned with cheesing for the camera, giving empty speeches and acting like the \"Great White Hope\" to the blacks in order to maintain his office.
