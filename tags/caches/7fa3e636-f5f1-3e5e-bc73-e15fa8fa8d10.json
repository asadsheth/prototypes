Ford tells the story like this: During track testing, its engineers experienced too much front-end lift, which can compromise steering efficacy. An aerodynamics engineer slapped a piece of duct tape over the grille's lower gap, the front-end lift was eliminated and the car handled much better around corners. Anyone who's ever coded something can attest that one small change in one place can have far-reaching effects everywhere else.
