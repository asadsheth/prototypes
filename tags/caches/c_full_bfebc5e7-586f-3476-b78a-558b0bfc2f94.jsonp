She also was able to eventually bring me and my oldest brother from Costa Rica in 1989, when I was 8 years old, and he not yet 20. So enough with the BS!

You cannot serve satan and God, sin has nothing to do with Holiness, and the darkness of sin has nothing to do with the Light of Righteousness. Jesus said No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon (Sin, Worldliness, Money).  And there is absolutely not a 3rd gender read in the Holy Bible Genesis 2:7-25 to learn how God created only two genders man for the woman, and woman for the man and put them together in holy matrimony. Also if you truly want to know how God feels about the lgbtq lifestyle read what he did to the lgbtq people in the two cities of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis chapter 19.   He completely burned up all the people in these two cities because they gave themselves over to the lgbtq lifestyle. God said in Romans 1:26 For this cause God gave up to vile affections, for even their women changed the natural use of their bodies into that which is against nature. Romans 1:27 and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the women burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working that which is unnatural, and receiving in themselves the repayment of their error which is meet. Romans 1:32 Who knowing the judgement of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of DEATH. The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Jesus loves all sinners but he hates sin and will destroy it and all associated with sin, unless they repent of their sin. That's why he died on the cross as a sin sacrifice for all mankind. That if we believe in him and obey him, he will forgive us of our sins, and we can look forward to going to heaven through faith in Jesus Christ.","message_id":"abb7d52f-eedf-44de-9c80-67b11ad9db16","context_id":"ce866b24-4f1b-3a8a-b29b-cfd96ad6ba96","upvotes":4,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"19632017","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_Y_jl.jpg","author_guid":"5BHJJEMUZDWKPDI325VTAECFS4","score":0.51818696077136,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-bfebc5e7-586f-3476-b78a-558b0bfc2f94_c-f83b447f-0e00-3128-a244-71908b8c5817_a-ce866b24-4f1b-3a8a-b29b-cfd96ad6ba96","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/listen-to-america\/lgbtq-youth-utah-deserve-life-1wx6lsz","author":"third_watch","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/lgbtq-youth-utah-deserve-life-172051760.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/huffpost_fp_modules_949\/bb79873de473025d0bacb33ad78e199f","title":"LGBTQ Youth In Utah Deserve A Life Of Hope","summary":"Located in Provo, Utah, a community where about 90 percent of its residents\u00a0affiliate with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Encircle: LGBTQ Family and Youth Resource Center opened its doors to the public earlier this year.
