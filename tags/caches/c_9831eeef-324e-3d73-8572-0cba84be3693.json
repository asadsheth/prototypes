Porter was the leading wicket-taker in the County Championship last season with 75 scalps during Essex's march to the title. \"While it was initially surprising and disappointing for Jamie and for us to discover he has a stress fracture, we have agreed with him","published_at":1508204468,"content_id":"b7b6d4a3-47b4-3952-84d7-cab1db963eb8","content_url":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/story\/_\/id\/21043958\/porter-ruled-lions-tour-back-stress-fracture","content_published_at":1508182169,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693_c-9d72f437-7967-37c2-9e6b-8727466cdcf6_a-e3059359-2b25-311b-99e2-9317feef77ae","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/cricket\/india-vs-zealand-kane-williamsons-4o628jc","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"hindustantimes.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-vs-new-zealand-2017\/india-vs-new-zealand-kane-williamson-s-side-aim-for-good-start-vs-board-president-s-xi\/story-Qmy8LVD09zDmZ4sP1hjZeO.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/QZdvhMrrh76_jpO0RJdLJQ--\/dz05NjA7aD01NDA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_e3059359-2b25-311b-99e2-9317feef77ae-755786993.jpeg","title":"India vs New Zealand: Kane Williamson's side aim for good start vs Board President's...","summary":"New Zealand have adopted a meticulous approach to their upcoming limited-overs series against India starting Sunday, and their preparations will get another boost with two 50-over warm-up matches against Indian Board President's XI. The first game will be played at the Brabourne Stadium on Tuesday, with the Kiwis looking to find their best possible XI before they take on India. The Kiwis arrived as many as 10 days before what their captain Kane Williamson called it a 'short tour' to leave no stone unturned in preparations for the three-match ODI and T20I series against India. Six of the 15-member squad were picked from the New Zealand A team which was already in India playing unofficial four-day Tests and limited-overs matches.","published_at":1508184071,"content_id":"e3059359-2b25-311b-99e2-9317feef77ae","content_url":"http:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/india-vs-new-zealand-2017\/india-vs-new-zealand-kane-williamson-s-side-aim-for-good-start-vs-board-president-s-xi\/story-Qmy8LVD09zDmZ4sP1hjZeO.html","content_published_at":1508182200,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Cricket","vibe_id":"9831eeef-324e-3d73-8572-0cba84be3693"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":28,"bot":true}]
