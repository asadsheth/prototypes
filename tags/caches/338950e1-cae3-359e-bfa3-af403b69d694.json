We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed.
