Hurricane Maria, which destroyed infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, had no impact on third-quarter GDP growth as the islands are not included in the United States' national accounts.","published_at":1509103609,"content_id":"113a4701-7f6d-3df2-8e25-de3c898ac6d6","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/u-economy-grows-3-percent-third-quarter-inventories-123351516--finance.html","content_published_at":1509111122,"content_relative_time":2,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-b36bf235-93a7-3a9b-92c0-58b19bda4189_a-538ef471-16d1-3ed8-9c5b-6e8c5e412159","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/37-small-quote-tattoos-help-4dc3t6j","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"POPSUGAR Smart Living","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/smart-living\/Small-Quote-Tattoos-40671353","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/lDN1S1zSp1fVBNKFAR1TwA--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_538ef471-16d1-3ed8-9c5b-6e8c5e412159--53949009.jpeg","title":"These 37 Small Quote Tattoos Will Help You Follow BIG Dreams","summary":"Sometimes all it takes is just a little inspiration to help you make big moves.

Trump's plan would balloon the deficit and add to the $20 trillion national debt, according to critics and independent analysts, but Republicans say the tax cuts proposed in the plan would be offset by economic growth that would generate new tax revenue.

With all the information we've gotten about Kate's duties as duchess, we started thinking about what her life was like before she was thrust into the spotlight as a global icon. Sure, in a lot of ways she's changed since getting married (who hasn't?), but we have to believe that underneath her title, she's still the same old Kate.
