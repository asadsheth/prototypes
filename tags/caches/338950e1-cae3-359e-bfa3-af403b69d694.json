Last week, the Senate and the House took the first steps on tax reform. The House passed its budget on the House floor while the Senate moved its own version out of committee, a crucial step in unlocking the GOP's ability to use reconciliation for tax reform; that process allows the Senate to pass its package with only 51 votes.
