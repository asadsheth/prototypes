In what was billed as a clash between the two top sides of the group, Mali had gone down to Paraguay 2-3 despite levelling things at 2-2 at one point. While their comeback had indeed been impressive, their frail defence line that fell apart in the first 17 minutes will be a cause of concern for the African champions. Against Turkey, they face a tricky opponent who are yet to unleash their full potential.

One is that they can't imagine a huge number of Americans\u2014especially those in the Trump tribe\u2014actually sitting down and meditating. The other reason people laugh at this salvation scenario is that they think the point of meditation is to cultivate love or compassion or some other warm and fuzzy feeling that might heal the nation.
