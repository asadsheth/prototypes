In what was billed as a clash between the two top sides of the group, Mali had gone down to Paraguay 2-3 despite levelling things at 2-2 at one point. While their comeback had indeed been impressive, their frail defence line that fell apart in the first 17 minutes will be a cause of concern for the African champions. Against Turkey, they face a tricky opponent who are yet to unleash their full potential.

Set in the United States in December 2003 \u2013 when U.S. forces in Iraq were dragging Saddam Hussein out of a \"spider hole\" - it is the story of three ageing former servicemen who reunite to bury the son of one of them who has been killed in action. With President Donald Trump saying he could \"totally destroy\" North Korea and characterising a dinner with military commanders as \"the calm before the storm\", Cranston said \"Last Flag Flying\" was a timely reminder of the effect on normal Americans of ill-advised military campaigns.","published_at":1507491922,"content_id":"6692a4a5-ed8a-3908-9910-2d73d9db5ffe","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/music\/linklaters-war-veteran-comedy-speaks-modern-america-says-194734083--finance.html","content_published_at":1507492054,"content_relative_time":51,"vibe_name":"United States"},{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-1429e769-5793-35f4-8985-5caef8cdedf7_a-039972bf-ca34-3b18-ac8e-6316d07f14f5","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/mindfulness-meditation-save-america-6de2iyf","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"WIRED","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/how-mindful-meditation-can-save-us-from-the-tribal-abyss?mbid=social_twitter","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Hp6hsPB7y6_91Ckjd1DYzw--\/dz0xODg1O2g9OTg3O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_039972bf-ca34-3b18-ac8e-6316d07f14f5--1879051533.jpeg","title":"How Mindfulness Meditation Can Save America","summary":"There's a reason some people laugh when I say that mindfulness meditation can save the United States\u2014that it can dampen the political polarization now dividing the country; that it can defuse the hatreds that have propelled the word \u201ctribal\u201d into our political vocabulary and have led serious commentators to compare the US in 2017 to Northern Ireland, even Yugoslavia, in the 1990s. One is that they can't imagine a huge number of Americans\u2014especially those in the Trump tribe\u2014actually sitting down and meditating. The other reason people laugh at this salvation scenario is that they think the point of meditation is to cultivate love or compassion or some other warm and fuzzy feeling that might heal the nation. Other kinds of Buddhist meditation\u2014such as \u201cmetta\u201d meditation\u2014take on that challenge more directly.","published_at":1507486510,"content_id":"039972bf-ca34-3b18-ac8e-6316d07f14f5","content_url":"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/how-mindful-meditation-can-save-us-from-the-tribal-abyss?mbid=social_twitter","content_published_at":1507460400,"content_relative_time":60,"vibe_name":"United States"},{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-8781c749-7c86-35f1-85ef-3319e8765913_a-94ed7560-161a-3256-9e06-ae9c34802dd4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/u-mission-turkey-suspends-visa-5rjqkph","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/u-mission-turkey-suspends-visa-173600079.html","img":null,"title":"U.S. mission to Turkey suspends visa services for security reasons","summary":"The U.S. mission to Turkey said on Sunday it had suspended all non-immigrant visa services at all U.S. diplomatic facilities in Turkey, on the grounds that it needed to \"reassess\" Turkey's commitment to its personnel. \"Recent events have forced the United States government to reassess the commitment of government of Turkey to the security of U.S. mission and personnel,\" the statement by the mission in Ankara said.","published_at":1507484352,"content_id":"94ed7560-161a-3256-9e06-ae9c34802dd4","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/u-mission-turkey-suspends-visa-173600079.html","content_published_at":1507484160,"content_relative_time":53,"vibe_name":"United States"},{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-547728a8-3db8-3c78-994a-84aa1f8fc9b8_a-7de679d2-de90-3d1f-8953-c00076a88beb","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/hezbollah-leader-says-u-actions-aiding-islamic-state-2fzqzma","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Reuters","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/hezbollah-leader-says-u-actions-aiding-islamic-state-161602382.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/2017-10-08T161602Z_1_LYNXMPED970IT_RTROPTP_2_MIDEAST-CRISIS-LEBANON-ASHURA.JPG","title":"Hezbollah leader says U.S. actions aiding Islamic State in Syria","summary":"Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Sunday that the United States was serving the interests of Islamic State by preventing the Syrian army and its allies advancing in some areas of eastern Syria.
