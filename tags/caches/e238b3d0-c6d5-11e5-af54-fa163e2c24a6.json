James is typically pulling the strings for the Cavs anyway, but it was a little different to see him operating from the point guard position.","published_at":1508895969,"content_id":"2087d4e7-dcfb-33ae-9272-56d40c13400c","content_url":"http:\/\/www.sportingnews.com\/nba\/news\/lebron-james-point-guard-cleveland-cavaliers-cavs-chicago-bulls\/117yx94nuc3131bfb0wqdzpy56?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","content_published_at":1508897715,"content_relative_time":38,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-3f5c9d5a-b0bf-3443-aaab-b68e0ed2ff3e_a-0cf06ae1-fba9-35f1-8946-50b5fad4e7f4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-3f5c9d5a-b0bf-3443-aaab-b68e0ed2ff3e_a-0cf06ae1-fba9-35f1-8946-50b5fad4e7f4","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"NESN.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/nesn.com\/2017\/10\/warriors-stephen-curry-console-grieving-nephew-of-mavs-devin-harris\/","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/D6sznI6I6wS7SnnhkkAKog--\/dz04MDA7aD00NTA7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_0cf06ae1-fba9-35f1-8946-50b5fad4e7f4-1278498581.jpeg","title":"Stephen Curry, Warriors Console Grieving Nephew Of Mavs' Devin Harris","summary":"Stephen Curry's competitiveness hasn't blocked his powers of sympathy.

Marcin Gortat called it disrespectful. Brooks thought it was unusual. However, the officials ruled the contact as\u00a0deliberate, and the end of the\u00a0Washington Wizards' 109-104 win on Monday night turned into a contentious and strange moment between the young talented big man and the veteran coach. \u201cThat's something you don't do,\u201d Wall said. \u201cNo matter what's going on between players and teammates. That's something you don't do to a coach. That's like me calling a coach a certain name. Hopefully he apologizes to [Brooks] but luckily we got the win.\u201d Jokic scored a game-high 29 points on 9-of-14 shooting","published_at":1508816175,"content_id":"e6955df1-3cfb-33b0-bbc7-8b8fa6c4980e","content_url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/wizards-insider\/wp\/2017\/10\/24\/referee-says-nuggets-nikola-jokic-intentionally-bumped-wizards-coach-scott-brooks\/","content_published_at":1508823600,"content_relative_time":58,"vibe_name":"NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"}]
