Fresh off their first division title since 1979 and a playoff run to Game 7 of the second round, the Washington Wizards carry confidence in spades. They are young and talented, and sharp-shooting guard Bradley Beal believes they are ready to take the step up to the top of their conference. \"For us, we have all of our pieces. We got our core back together. We've got playoff experience. There's really no excuse for us not to take that next step,\" Beal told ESPN. \"We control our own destiny at this point.\" \"I feel like we're the best team [in the Eastern Conference],\" Beal added.","published_at":1509744858,"content_id":"a589f88d-cdc8-3393-8dbb-e669f384c4a8","content_url":"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/article\/2017\/11\/03\/lebron-james-silences-confident-wizards-milestone-filled-performance\/?rss=true","content_published_at":1509783853,"content_relative_time":63,"vibe_name":"[legacy] NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-afeb4d19-72c3-3dff-b6b1-69b7597cd92f_a-c1b93974-9b89-3100-b87e-11e05c5fcffa","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-afeb4d19-72c3-3dff-b6b1-69b7597cd92f_a-c1b93974-9b89-3100-b87e-11e05c5fcffa","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Bloomberg","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/good-news-401-k-tax-090116382.html","img":"http:\/\/globalfinance.zenfs.com\/en_us\/News\/Reuters\/c3dcb3f60d1d05fbb7d4ec86ced7dce2","title":"There\u2019s Some Good News About 401(k)s in the Tax Bill","summary":"Hardship withdrawal and loan repayment rules are tweaked","published_at":1509745034,"content_id":"c1b93974-9b89-3100-b87e-11e05c5fcffa","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/good-news-401-k-tax-090116382.html","content_published_at":1509699676,"content_relative_time":86,"vibe_name":"[legacy] NBA","vibe_id":"e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6"},{"post_id":"v-e238b3d0-c6d5-11e5-af54-fa163e2c24a6_c-791470a7-83cc-3b41-84bd-baeaa1bb0e7f_a-22ffc49f-8d4d-338a-be0f-f553ccac7248","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/nba\/lebron-james-jumped-way-over-3tam302","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"USA Today","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/sports\/ftw\/2017\/11\/03\/lebron-james-jumped-over-bradley-beal-while-dribbling-down-court-in-cavs-win\/107319796\/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatodaycomnba-topstories","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3y5dx7rt8kBfRwDwF6auzQ--\/dz0zMjAwO2g9MTY4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_22ffc49f-8d4d-338a-be0f-f553ccac7248--228722088.jpeg","title":"LeBron James jumped all the way over Bradley Beal","summary":"LeBron James apparently didn't feel like dribbling all the way around Bradley Beal in the third quarter of the Cavaliers' win over the Wizards on Friday night, so instead, James jumped over Beal.

The Hawks were without five rotation players and had not won since opening night. They have made no secret that this was to be a rebuilding year, and it was the Cavaliers who swept them out of two straight playoff series in 2015 and 2016 when Atlanta was a formidable Eastern Conference contender.

One\u00a0focuses on a handful of teams outpacing preseason projections through their first 10 games, looking like they have a chance to prove their doubters wrong over the course of the next few months. But will they? Or is the success experienced by those teams only fleeting, and likely to regress? That's what we'll attempt to decipher, as we look at the five\u00a0most surprising teams in the NBA in an attempt to decide whether their play can last or\u00a0is a case of playing above their heads. 1.
