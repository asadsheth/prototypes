Earlier this month, two-time NBA champion and actual velociraptor Chris Bosh was spotted at the Lakers practice facility chatting it up with general manager Rob Pelinka, who Bosh signed to represent him just under a year ago in November 2016.

Kuzma went No. 27 in this year's NBA Draft, and wasn't much well-known outside of the Pac-12 fandom. He was truly an afterthought to the Lakers' big move to draft Lonzo Ball No. 2 overall and trade D'Angelo Russell for Brook Lopez -- the No. 27 pick belonged to Brooklyn, and the Nets sent it to the Lakers in the deal.
