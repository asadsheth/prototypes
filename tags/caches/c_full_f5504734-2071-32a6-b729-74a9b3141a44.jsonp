The new element has been named Pelosium. Pelosium has one neutron, 12 assistant neutrons, 75 deputy neutrons, and 224 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 311. These particles are held together by dark particles called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons. The symbol of Pelosium is PU. Pelosium's mass actually increases over time, as morons randomly interact with various elements in the atmosphere and become assistant deputy neutrons within the Pelosium molecule, leading to the formation of isodopes. This characteristic of moron-promotion leads some scientist to believe that Pelosium is formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as Critical Morass. When catalyzed with money, Pelosium activates CNNadnausium, an element that radiates orders of magnitude more energy, albeit as incoherent noise, since it has half as many peons but twice as many morons as Pelosium","message_id":"fabb9766-0ff6-4e33-adba-da540556d6b0","context_id":"d7c09202-cfcb-3dea-b35b-74971dcef552","upvotes":94,"downvotes":18,"reports":0,"replies":10,"author_name":"castlerocku","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_C_jl.jpg","author_guid":"DPYAOMBD5QF5T4CCXTNR6XQ4ZQ","score":0.84616506917491,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-40640b23-7b63-37f5-864c-03b6335fd3f7_a-d7c09202-cfcb-3dea-b35b-74971dcef552","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/george-w-bush-says-america-20dfmxc","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/george-w-bush-says-america-162409057.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_news_328\/9f1727114077214bd6b5b8450c3fe315","title":"George W.

But you don\u2019t have to carry a torch for the North Korean government or be a card-carrying member of the Kim Jong-un Appreciation Society to acknowledge that the country\u2019s leadership has actually been behaving very rationally. Because recent history tells us that the best way to deter an attack from Nahtzee amerika and its stooges is not to disarm, dress up as John Lennon and make statements about how much you desire peace, but to do the exact opposite.\n\nConsider what happened to Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya. Like the DPRK, all three were Nahtzee amerikan \u2018target states\u2019. And all three were destroyed and their leaders killed. Do we honestly think these countries would have been attacked had they possessed nukes or missiles that could reach Nahtzee amerikan targets? Of course not. Detailed analysis of these conflicts shows us that Nahtzee amerika gets its way through a mixture of bluff followed by the use of military force, but only when it believes the risks are minimal, or non-existent. If it believes the risks are too high, it backs off and starts talking about the need for \u2018dialogue\u2019 and \u2018diplomacy\u2019.\n\nThat's the terrorist thugs of Nahtzee Amerika to a T.\n\nRussia and China must collaborate to wipe the terrorist thugs of Nahtzee Amerika from the face of the Earth.","message_id":"8bd4e5ac-57c8-4578-82fc-93d93b1a3d01","context_id":"320924c1-24f3-38ce-989d-3b8b888cd9d4","upvotes":2,"downvotes":5,"reports":0,"replies":5,"author_name":"sdf","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/33df974b434cca9c149b851a1341ee60_192.jpeg","author_guid":"PCQZP73FY7VSX2BA35C2GKA5SA","score":0.34218746389508,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-e8842072-9c84-3410-a35f-193f08a2e81a_a-320924c1-24f3-38ce-989d-3b8b888cd9d4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/armageddon-accident-5sb2y91","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Foreign Policy Magazine","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/armageddon-accident-125907632.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/foreign_policy_magazine\/8b36984c74d8387a87876b65ba0dd2bb","title":"Armageddon by Accident","summary":"Trump and Kim\u2019s brinkmanship raises the danger of an accidental conflict on the Korean Peninsula.","published_at":1508407727,"content_id":"320924c1-24f3-38ce-989d-3b8b888cd9d4","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/armageddon-accident-125907632.html","content_published_at":1508331547,"content_relative_time":34,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44"},"created_at":1508422817,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":false},{"text":"Can we shoot one at trump","message_id":"8258bb06-2fbe-41b5-93ba-8e9eb0372bc6","context_id":"320924c1-24f3-38ce-989d-3b8b888cd9d4","upvotes":1,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"R","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_jd_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"SJ4LEZQ64KTDNAWK2JWX2XJLT4","score":0.3395700843609,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-e8842072-9c84-3410-a35f-193f08a2e81a_a-320924c1-24f3-38ce-989d-3b8b888cd9d4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/armageddon-accident-5sb2y91","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Foreign Policy Magazine","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/armageddon-accident-125907632.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/foreign_policy_magazine\/8b36984c74d8387a87876b65ba0dd2bb","title":"Armageddon by Accident","summary":"Trump and Kim\u2019s brinkmanship raises the danger of an accidental conflict on the Korean Peninsula.","published_at":1508407727,"content_id":"320924c1-24f3-38ce-989d-3b8b888cd9d4","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/armageddon-accident-125907632.html","content_published_at":1508331547,"content_relative_time":34,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44"},"created_at":1508422902,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":false},{"text":"Sri Lanka is in perpetual debt to China over China's infrastructure deals in Sri Lanka made with the previous corrupt Sri Lankan leader.

The small island in the South Pacific boasted a 3.2 per cent rise in the number of holidaymakers arriving at its sandy shores in 2017, up to 1.56 million, despite the impending threat of nuclear annihilation. So what can its many travellers expect from Guam? These fascinating facts might give you an idea... Guam is a US Territory, but not a state Credit: \u00c2\u00a9Hideomi - stock.adobe.com 1. It is American, but not a state Unlike Puerto Rico, which is inching towards becoming the USA\u2019s 51st state, Guam is unlikely to join America\u2019s top table of legal status any time soon. It is defined as a \u201cTerritory of the United States\u201d. There are currently 16 such entities, although only five of them are inhabited (the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa in the Pacific, and the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, join Puerto Rico and Guam in having actual residents while happily flying the Stars and Stripes). Territories have certain voting rights and protection from the US courts. However, their citizens cannot vote in presidential elections. 2. It is the second southernmost part of America The only part of Uncle Sam\u2019s domain which lies further towards Antarctica than Guam is American Samoa, which hangs out (relatively) near to Fiji, at a latitude of 14.2\u00b0S. The countries with the most islands Guam, by contrast, skulks on the other side of the equator \u2013 close (give or take the best part of 1600 miles) to the Philippines, at 13.4\u00b0N. But this is still a fair distance south of more recognised parts of America. Key West, at the lower tip of Florida, pins its colours to 24.5\u00b0N. Naalehu, at the southern end of Hawaii\u2019s \u201cBig Island\u201d, has a latitude of 19.0\u00b0N. 3. It\u2019s a long way from most places\u2026 Guam\u2019s American colleagues, the Northern Mariana Islands, lie close at hand \u2013 a 128-mile hop to the north-east. But Tokyo is a rather larger leap of 1,570 miles over the horizon. Los Angeles? That\u2019s 6,086 miles distant. London? That\u2019s 7,476 miles, and a couple of changes of planes away.

Erm, gulp. 4. \u2026but you can still get there Guam\u2019s Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport is a broad-armed host to a decent selection of airlines \u2013 not least United (0845 844 4777; united.com), which uses it as a regional hub. United\u2019s link to Hong Kong may the best bet for reaching Guam from the UK, although you could also fly in with Philippines Airlines (via Manila; 00632 855 8888; philippineairlines.com) \u2013 or with Delta (via Tokyo; 0871 221 1222; delta.com). What's left of the British Empire (and how to visit it) 5. It was an early adopter of air travel Guam was a stop for the \u201cClipper\u201d flying boats operated by Pan Am in the Thirties and early Forties \u2013 one of the most romantic eras for aviation. The now-defunct airline launched a route from San Francisco to Manila in 1935, with a Sikorsky S-42 \u201cflying boat\u201d hopping its way across the Pacific \u2013 also halting at Honolulu. The one-way fare \u2013 US$950 (\u00a3738); about US$16,000 (\u00a312,429) at current rates \u2013 was not cheap, but the flight crossed the ocean at a rate more than two weeks quicker than the fastest steamship.

The Portuguese went there a long time ago Guam is not so remotely placed that it was beyond the telescopes and wanderlust of the great European explorers. In fact, (arguably) the greatest of them all, Fernando Magellan, spotted it on the first voyage of circumnavigation (1519-1522), calling at Guam on March 6 1521. Of course, this paragraph requires a little qualification. While Magellan is often credited as the first man to sail around the world, he was killed en route, dying in a pitched battle with locals in the Philippines on April 27 1521 (the journey was completed by Spanish voyager Juan Sebastian Elcano, who sailed its last ship, the Victoria, home to Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, arriving on September 6 1522). Top 5 | Island paradises with dark secrets Guam was effectively the final friendly place Magellan saw before coming to what was a very sticky end. Lots of spears. The view is as good under water 7. Guam has long had an indigenous population \u201cFriendly\u201d also requires a caveat. Antonio Pigafetta, the Italian scholar who documented Magellan\u2019s voyage, was less than charitable about the residents of Guam. They were, he said, wily souls who \u201centered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on\u201d, including \"the small boat that was fastened to the poop of the flagship.\u201d\u00a0Continuing this pen-assassination, he wrote that \u201cthose people are poor, but ingenious and very thievish.\u201d Still, first impressions are but the smallest snapshot. Fast forward 500 years, and Guam is known for the warmness of its welcome. Its indigenous inhabitants are the Chamorro people. They are believed to have populated the island since around 2000 BC, when they moved into Micronesia from Southeast Asia. They brought the Chamorro language with them. This is now thriving as a fundamental part of the isle\u2019s modern school curriculum. 8. It was Spanish for a fair while\u2026 Guam spent more than 300 years as a Spanish colonial possession. It was claimed by Madrid in 1565 (although not properly colonised until 1668), and remained so-tethered until 1898, when defeat for Spain in the Spanish-American War \u2013 a tussle that also took in the status of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines \u2013 saw it occupied by US forces. Fragments of Spanish rule remain. The Fort Nuestra Senora de la Soledad is one of them \u2013 a stronghold that was built by Spain between 1802 and 1819 to help protect its ships as they crossed the Pacific from the Philippines to Mexico. Located close to Umatac in the south-west of the island, the fort has been on America\u2019s National Register of Historic Places since 1974. 9. \u2026 but has been American for well over a century Guam officially became American in the Treaty of Paris, which was signed on December 10 1898. This was a pretty seismic moment, which effectively disbanded the Spanish Empire, and gave America a good shove down the road towards becoming a superpower. 18 idyllic islands you've probably never heard of Its nationality has not changed since, although the island did enter dark waters between December 8 1941 and August 10 1944, when it was occupied by Japan. The Battle of Guam (July 21-August 10 1944) wrenched it back into US control. This was a distinctly bleak period for Guam \u2013 it is estimated that 10 per cent of its population died due to forced labour, execution and incarceration during the 31 months that Japan was in charge. 10. For some on Guam, the war didn\u2019t end until 1972 Ever heard the one about the Japanese soldier who did not know the Second World War was over? There were several of these stubborn souls scattered around the Pacific Rim, and one of them was hiding in Guam. Shoichi Yokoi did not surrender until January 24 1972, having concealed himself deep in the island\u2019s jungle near the southerly village of Talofofo. He had spent the 28 years since America\u2019s recapture of Guam living in an underground cave \u2013 despite the fact that, he later revealed, he had learned that the war was over in 1952, but was afraid to declare himself. \u201cWe Japanese soldiers were told to prefer death to the disgrace of getting captured alive,\u201d he commented. Tourists can visit his subterranean abode. Sort of. \u201cYokoi\u2019s Cave\u201d is now part of the popular Talofofo Falls Resort Park (visitguam.com\/listings\/Talofofo-Falls-Resort-Park\/346). The original was destroyed by a typhoon, but a replica, reached by rope ladder, offers insight into his life. 11. The Second World War has national-park status in Guam The bloody events of 1941-1944 are protected in Guam in the form of War In The Pacific National Historical Park (nps.gov\/wapa). This comprises various locations, trenches, gun emplacements and battlesites across the island \u2013 including Ga\u2019an Point and Agat Beach, on the west coast, where American troops landed for the liberation fight on July 21 1944. 12. The capital had to be restored Guam\u2019s capital is Hagatna. It sits roughly midway along the north-west coast. It rings with echoes of the Spanish era \u2013 in the shape of the Dulce Nombre de Maria Cathedral Basilica, a bastion of all things Catholic. There has been a cathedral on this site since 1669, when the new settlers constructed a first church from coralstone and ifil wood. However, this doughty building was lost to the heavy bombardment when US troops re-took the island in 1944. The present structure, quickly assembled, emerged in April 1959. 13. There are more romantic sites too One of Guam\u2019s most fabled landmarks is Two Lovers Point, a steep bluff at the upper end of Tumon Bay, on the north-west coast. According to local legend, this was the spot where a pair of entwined Chamorro inhabitants of the island \u2013 he a warrior, she the daughter of a local aristocrat \u2013 jumped to their deaths because she had been promised in marriage to a Spanish sea captain. It is probably an apocryphal tale, but the sunsets visible from the top of the crag, with the Pacific roaring below, are seductive all the same. 14. Tumon Bay is a holiday hotspot Arching its back for about three miles, Tumon Bay is home to some of Guam\u2019s prime hotels. Come here for a week, and there is a reasonable chance that you will soothe your soul at one of the resorts along this long strip of sand. The Hilton Guam Resort & Spa (hiltonguamresort.com) \u2013 double rooms from \u00a3121 per night \u2013 is one of them. The Lotte Hotel Guam (lottehotel.com\/guam) \u2013 double rooms from \u00a3208 per night \u2013 is a second. 15. The diving is pretty good Guam is the closest landmass to the Mariana Trench, the deepest point on the planet \u2013 which sinks all the way to 36,070ft (10,994m) below sea level. You don\u2019t, of course, need quite this much depth to enjoy a decent scuba holiday \u2013 and Guam can certainly oblige on the latter. Apra Harbor, on the west coast, is home to a number of accessible shipwrecks. These include the SMS Cormoran, a German merchant trader which sank during the First World War \u2013 and the Tokai Maru, a Japanese freighter that was sunk by an American submarine on August 27 1943. Curiously, these two vessels touch on the seabed, meaning that underwater enthusiasts can explore them on the same dive. PADI provides a list of Guam sub-aqua sites and accredited dive shops, at padi.com\/scuba-vacations\/micronesia. 16. Tourists far outnumber locals All these attractions, and its fine weather, mean that Guam is pretty popular. So much so that, according to figures from the World Trade Organization, there are almost eight (7.9, to be precise) visitors to Guam for every resident. This is a similar ratio to the British Virgin Islands (12.8) and Monaco (8.7). Guam\u2019s population, for the record, is 162,742. 17. It is a big chunk of America America has a lot of islands, and Guam is the 32nd biggest of them. That doesn\u2019t sound very sizeable \u2013 and, certainly, compared to the Big Island of Hawaii, which is the largest of these oceanic outcrops at 4,028 square miles, Guam is something of a pinprick in the Pacific. But, at 209 square miles in area, Guam is also the biggest island in Micronesia. It is bigger than, say, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts (91 square miles), Martha\u2019s neighbour Nantucket (48 square miles) \u2013 and also Manhattan (23 square miles). 18. It is quite urban in parts According to United Nations statistics, Guam is the 14th most urbanised location on Earth. However, this does not indicate that it is swamped by urban sprawl \u2013 merely that a very high proportion of its people live in towns and \u201ccities\u201d. And there is still room to breathe and smell the fresh air in green spaces such as Guam National Wildlife Refuge, which frames the very northern tip of the island, at Ritidian Point (fws.gov\/refuge\/guam). 19. The brown tree snake did a bad thing Head to Guam National Wildlife Refuge, and you may see the endangered Mariana fruit bat. You may also see the Guam kingfisher or the Mariana crow. But chances are, you will have to look exceedingly carefully for anything with wings and feathers. There were no snakes on the island until the Second World War, when a brown tree snake \u2013 native to Australia and Papua New Guinea, but not Micronesia \u2013 slipped onto Guam unseen as a stowaway on a US military ship. With no natural predators in this idyllic outpost, it and its offspring made hay in the sunshine, all but eliminating the bird population. Efforts have been made to limit its impact, and protect what remains of the isle\u2019s avian residents. The snake is mildly venomous, but not a danger to humans. 20. If it\u2019s daytime in Britain, it\u2019s probably night in Guam To re-emphasise just how far Guam is from the UK, it is worth stating that the island operates in a time zone of GMT +10. If you are reading this over lunch, Guam is asleep.","published_at":1508326216,"content_id":"2ef32080-f231-3c8b-96c3-6b8d66b5607d","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/shipwrecks-lost-soldiers-devastating-snakes-135441240.html","content_published_at":1508325300,"content_relative_time":35,"vibe_name":"United States","vibe_id":"f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":35,"bot":true},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-1567b478-8404-3a4f-a730-7cd8e7df0675_a-8cc77b58-44ee-3f3b-ab6f-c65226a636ac","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/united-states\/v-f5504734-2071-32a6-b729-74a9b3141a44_c-1567b478-8404-3a4f-a730-7cd8e7df0675_a-8cc77b58-44ee-3f3b-ab6f-c65226a636ac","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"scout.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/scout.com\/military\/warrior\/Article\/What-if-America-Launched-a-Nuclear-Attack-on-North-Korea-109106305","img":"https:\/\/s1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/8Zd5bN085i1GeV086phKug--\/dz0xMjAwO2g9NjMwO3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_8cc77b58-44ee-3f3b-ab6f-c65226a636ac--2066915091.jpeg","title":"What if America Launched a Nuclear Attack on North Korea?","summary":"The standoff between the United States and North Korea continues to escalate with neither side willing to back down.
