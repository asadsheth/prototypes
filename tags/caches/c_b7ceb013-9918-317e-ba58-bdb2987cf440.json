The 50-person aerospace engineering firm was compromised in July last year but the national cyber security agency, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), only became aware of the breach in November, technology website ZDNet Australia reported. Some 30GB of \"sensitive data\" subjected to restricted access under the US government's International Traffic in Arms Regulations rules were stolen, ASD's Mitchell Clarke told a security conference Wednesday according to ZDNet.","published_at":1507766651,"content_id":"dec84708-a96e-3f25-8498-be4d00b2ba0a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/f-35-stealth-fighter-data-stolen-australia-defence-025643281.html","content_published_at":1507777003,"content_relative_time":44,"vibe_name":"InfoSec","vibe_id":"b7ceb013-9918-317e-ba58-bdb2987cf440"},"created_at":1507784471,"comment_relative_time":42,"bot":false},{"text":"Be honest.
