It is not so easy to be one of those women and be forced into a situation where you have to decide between letting a man be inappropriate with you or letting a man with all the power ruin everything you've worked for. Can you honestly say it would be easy to make that decision? Trust me, it isn't and in a culture where rape and sexual assault are widely looked at as \"lesser crimes\", it makes it even that much harder to make the decision to come forward. 14 years ago I was raped. Even back then I had seen and heart too many stories of women coming forward only to have no one believe them or worse yet accuse them of bringing in on themselves or deserving it somehow. I was too scared to come forward and my rapist was never prosecuted. Just 2 years after that happened, I was sexually assaulted by a police officer. He pulled me over for a routine traffic stop and when I told him I didn't have my ID on me, he insisted I get out of my car and get into the back of his squad while he verified my identity. Before doing so, he made me stand in the pouring rain and after not even asking me if I preferred him to call for a female office, he proceeded to pat me down. The pat down was more than invasive. He groped my crotch and firmly squeezed both my breasts before finally ushering me into the back of his squad. I was terrified that he was going to rape me but he didn't. And I didn't report that assault either and you know why? Because who was I? Who would believe me? It was his word against mine and I was a 23 year old nobody. That's what the lack of true care over sex crimes has come to. I can only hope that Harvey Weinstein's fall from grace might just be the turning point and that one day soon, women and men will no longer have to be afraid to speak out because we can finally feel like someone will listen.","message_id":"faf8ce0d-6764-4b8e-b389-508df7416615","context_id":"fe197ffc-23bf-3ee8-a5a7-2ca6021bf83c","upvotes":12,"downvotes":5,"reports":0,"replies":7,"author_name":"Amber","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_A_kl_2_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"TMLR4LGCWHOE5PD63SQXWDCREM","score":0.67357257826067,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-4526b714-77fa-3e89-9014-42e938b924c6_a-fe197ffc-23bf-3ee8-a5a7-2ca6021bf83c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-4526b714-77fa-3e89-9014-42e938b924c6_a-fe197ffc-23bf-3ee8-a5a7-2ca6021bf83c","author":"nanook","provider":"The Wrap","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/game-thrones-star-lena-headey-recalls-harvey-weinstein-174429568.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en_US\/News\/TheWrap\/8216Game_of_Thrones8217_Star_Lena-de339bd17ef83f1bf1c19bac5ad7d36b","title":"\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Star Lena Headey Says Harvey Weinstein \u2018Furious\u2019 After She Rejected Him","summary":"\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star Lena Headey has joined the growing number of women who\u2019ve accused Harvey Weinstein of inappropriate behavior.

Save for its edge-to-edge display and the camera housing notch, the iPhone X isn't really breaking any new ground. In fact, neither is Samsung, or really any other smartphone vendor for that matter. Which is exactly why ZTE's new Axon M smartphone, -- which comes from way out of left field -- is so intriguing. When I was first introduced to the Axon M a few weeks ago, I was tempted to write the dual screen phone off as little more than a gimmick. After all, what would anyone possibly need two displays for, much less two display that could be folded together? But after being given a walkthrough of the potential use cases, I began to understand how and why someone might prefer to own a compact device with two distinct displays instead of just one. When you first lay eyes on the Axon M, it looks like just another unspectacular Android smartphone. Measuring in at 5.2 inches, the display is smaller than that of many other flagship Android devices, and its massive bezels go against the trend of the all-screen phones that have begun to take over. But when you flip the phone over, you'll see a second display the same size as the first. This is where the Axon M takes on a life of its own. The display on the rear stays turned off until you begin to fold it forward, where it will eventually click into place alongside the other display. At this point, you have several ways you can choose to interact with the phone. When you press the \"M\" button at the bottom of the display (which you can see in the image above), a series of icons will appear in place of the standard Android buttons. Each of these icons will change the mode of the phone. There is an option to use both displays as if they were each distinct devices, an option to extend the display so that it stretches between both screens and an option to mirror the content on the first screen to the second. In an extensive demo, I was shown a wide variety of ways that each of the display modes could be employed. With each display operating as its own phone, it's possible to run two apps side by side, so you could have an email open on one screen and then open the calendar on the second screen to pencil in the date and time of a meeting. ZTE also explained that social media was a major consideration when building the Axon M. With two displays, a user can watch Game of Thrones on the top screen and tweet about it on the bottom. Because of the noticeable crease running through the center of the displays when the phone is folded out, the extended display isn't quite as seamless as I'd hoped it would be. That said, it's still quite a neat trick to be able to turn your phone into a tablet with the press of a button. As a device aimed at those who consume a lot of media on mobile, being able to watch YouTube, Netflix or DirecTV Now in full screen across two displays will be a major selling point. And finally, mirroring the display of the first screen on to the second seemed to be the least useful of the mode at first glance, but after playing\u00a0Battleship with a ZTE executive across the table and watching as he conducted a deskside presentation from one display while I watched on the other, I understood why it was included. Beyond the foldable dual screens, the Axon M is a capable Android smartphone. It features two 5.2-inch LCD FHQ displays, 2.15 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage (+ microSD card support), 20-megapixel camera with dual LED flash and dual image stabilization and runs on Android 7.1.2. ZTE's Axon M will be available to purchase exclusively from AT&T this holiday in the United States for under $700. The phone will also be available in Japan, China, Italy, Russia and other markets to be revealed in the future. Every Axon M comes with a free\u00a0Axon Passport 2.0 warranty and protection plan, good for two years.","published_at":1508251279,"content_id":"bd72406e-2894-372e-97b4-7a3e774675bc","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/zte-axon-m-packs-power-two-smartphones-one-144038113.html","content_published_at":1508251238,"content_relative_time":9,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508273824,"comment_relative_time":3,"bot":false},{"text":"ALEXANDER AND MURRYS SUPER DEAL IS NOTHING BUT A RE HASH ON THE SAME PLATE AND STILL USING UNCONSTITUTIONAL MONEY FROM THE TREASURY.

The police got rid of Jesus before he could go in and explain what happened in court putting the hotel at a huge disadvantage when it comes to monetary judgments. The police will always protect the casinos in Las Vegas! If the casinos need to kill somebody that owes the money, if the casinos need somebody taking out that is causing problems for their patrons\u2026 They will do it\u2026 With the help of the cops\u2026 I have lived in Las Vegas for many years, nothing has been more consistent than the police corruption.

Obamacare violates the 10th Amendment, States Rights Amendment of the Constitution by preventing citizens from voting on it.  Obamacare violates the 4th Amendment, the right to privacy Amendment.  Obamacare violates HIPPA privacy law issued by the Department of Health and Human Service entitled the \u201cHealth Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  More American scientists have won Nobel Prizes in Medicine than the other 226 countries combined.  Obamacare as defined by the Supreme Court is a tax.  Repeal it!  Obamacare is not about health nor is it about insurance.  Its primary purpose is to move $5.1 trillion in Gross Domestic Product produced by the health care and insurance industry from the private sector into the public sector, namely into the U.S. Treasury to be spent as Congress and the President see fit.  Its secondary purpose is to reduce government costs by depriving the poor of adequate health care to save government $533 billion dollars in Medicaid annually and to deprive the sick adequate health care to save government $588 billion in Medicare annually.  The caveat is that if they catch the elderly soon enough government can also save $924 million dollars in Social Security annually.  Under Obama we saw how government run health care worked at the Veterans Administration in Phoenix in 2015.  The VA killed 40 of America\u2019s finest by depriving them of basic health care, just to save money.  If government would kill America\u2019s finest they would not think twice about you or me.

He drove a Nissan Maxima 255,000 miles.  He refused to get rid of it.  It wasn't that he couldn't afford a new car.  He eventually replaced the Maxima with a Porsche Cayenne.  He just got really attached to that car and wanted to see how far his faithful steed would take him.  The whole time he was babying that Maxima I had to listen to him lament about an early 90's Civic hatchback he was still mourning.  I guess some people just get really attached to their cars.  Kudos to this young man for not getting caught in the trap of sudden wealth where your lifestyle expands to consume your available income.  If these athletes play their cards right, they can have a relatively short NFL career that will leave them financially secure for the rest of their life.  Bank the money and invest it.  Treat the investment income like an annuity, reinvest 20% of it each year and live comfortably off the other 80%.  You are basically set for life at a comfortable level.  Rob Gronkowski on the Patriots is another example.  Supposedly he's never touched a penny of his NFL earnings.  He lives off his endorsement earnings now and his NFL earnings are invested for the future.  These are smart young men.  It's sad that many NFL athletes end up broken and broke after a short 5 - 7 year career in professional football.","message_id":"fb7c87f5-3bb9-4116-b980-48edd14848bb","context_id":"933cd8e9-5715-3f2d-a4f5-f511ccc2e7d4","upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Trumpanzees","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/7e3fd079d9468077e67028e4abe7ffe5_192.jpeg","author_guid":"WB6KI2EDVZ3JILNEMQSFK2CKYU","score":0.42532861695292,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104_c-2158e2ab-c747-3328-8c8b-e27a673917e5_a-933cd8e9-5715-3f2d-a4f5-f511ccc2e7d4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/sports\/dallas-cowboys-running-back-alfred-14jbpxd","author":"third_watch","provider":"CNBC Videos","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/dallas-cowboys-running-back-alfred-125000391.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/video\/video.cnbc2.com\/df6c19949abb7d6f4f8a45e29c6c594b","title":"Dallas Cowboys running back Alfred Morris drives a $2 car","summary":null,"published_at":1508245817,"content_id":"933cd8e9-5715-3f2d-a4f5-f511ccc2e7d4","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/dallas-cowboys-running-back-alfred-125000391.html","content_published_at":1508244600,"content_relative_time":11,"vibe_name":"Sports","vibe_id":"5c839b50-00d3-37e8-a68f-7c03c48d7104"},"created_at":1508259122,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":false},{"text":"I think these clowns just want to hear themselves talk.

Save for its edge-to-edge display and the camera housing notch, the iPhone X isn't really breaking any new ground. In fact, neither is Samsung, or really any other smartphone vendor for that matter. Which is exactly why ZTE's new Axon M smartphone, -- which comes from way out of left field -- is so intriguing. When I was first introduced to the Axon M a few weeks ago, I was tempted to write the dual screen phone off as little more than a gimmick. After all, what would anyone possibly need two displays for, much less two display that could be folded together? But after being given a walkthrough of the potential use cases, I began to understand how and why someone might prefer to own a compact device with two distinct displays instead of just one. When you first lay eyes on the Axon M, it looks like just another unspectacular Android smartphone. Measuring in at 5.2 inches, the display is smaller than that of many other flagship Android devices, and its massive bezels go against the trend of the all-screen phones that have begun to take over. But when you flip the phone over, you'll see a second display the same size as the first. This is where the Axon M takes on a life of its own. The display on the rear stays turned off until you begin to fold it forward, where it will eventually click into place alongside the other display. At this point, you have several ways you can choose to interact with the phone. When you press the \"M\" button at the bottom of the display (which you can see in the image above), a series of icons will appear in place of the standard Android buttons. Each of these icons will change the mode of the phone. There is an option to use both displays as if they were each distinct devices, an option to extend the display so that it stretches between both screens and an option to mirror the content on the first screen to the second. In an extensive demo, I was shown a wide variety of ways that each of the display modes could be employed. With each display operating as its own phone, it's possible to run two apps side by side, so you could have an email open on one screen and then open the calendar on the second screen to pencil in the date and time of a meeting. ZTE also explained that social media was a major consideration when building the Axon M. With two displays, a user can watch Game of Thrones on the top screen and tweet about it on the bottom. Because of the noticeable crease running through the center of the displays when the phone is folded out, the extended display isn't quite as seamless as I'd hoped it would be. That said, it's still quite a neat trick to be able to turn your phone into a tablet with the press of a button. As a device aimed at those who consume a lot of media on mobile, being able to watch YouTube, Netflix or DirecTV Now in full screen across two displays will be a major selling point. And finally, mirroring the display of the first screen on to the second seemed to be the least useful of the mode at first glance, but after playing\u00a0Battleship with a ZTE executive across the table and watching as he conducted a deskside presentation from one display while I watched on the other, I understood why it was included. Beyond the foldable dual screens, the Axon M is a capable Android smartphone. It features two 5.2-inch LCD FHQ displays, 2.15 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage (+ microSD card support), 20-megapixel camera with dual LED flash and dual image stabilization and runs on Android 7.1.2. ZTE's Axon M will be available to purchase exclusively from AT&T this holiday in the United States for under $700. The phone will also be available in Japan, China, Italy, Russia and other markets to be revealed in the future. Every Axon M comes with a free\u00a0Axon Passport 2.0 warranty and protection plan, good for two years.","published_at":1508251279,"content_id":"bd72406e-2894-372e-97b4-7a3e774675bc","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/zte-axon-m-packs-power-two-smartphones-one-144038113.html","content_published_at":1508251238,"content_relative_time":9,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508257147,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":false},{"text":"Wouldn't buy it.

And finally, mirroring the display of the first screen on to the second seemed to be the least useful of the mode at first glance, but after playing\u00a0Battleship with a ZTE executive across the table and watching as he conducted a deskside presentation from one display while I watched on the other, I understood why it was included. Beyond the foldable dual screens, the Axon M is a capable Android smartphone. It features two 5.2-inch LCD FHQ displays, 2.15 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage (+ microSD card support), 20-megapixel camera with dual LED flash and dual image stabilization and runs on Android 7.1.2. ZTE's Axon M will be available to purchase exclusively from AT&T this holiday in the United States for under $700. The phone will also be available in Japan, China, Italy, Russia and other markets to be revealed in the future. Every Axon M comes with a free\u00a0Axon Passport 2.0 warranty and protection plan, good for two years.","published_at":1508251279,"content_id":"bd72406e-2894-372e-97b4-7a3e774675bc","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/zte-axon-m-packs-power-two-smartphones-one-144038113.html","content_published_at":1508251238,"content_relative_time":9,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508254280,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":false},{"text":"No one wants to ride their father's or grandfather's motorcycle.","message_id":"7a7ebcf5-628e-4dc6-8ed5-1489b5fd1cf6","context_id":"076054a6-7d27-3087-8a3b-c2b26079dd7c","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Super Dave","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_SD_ad.jpg","author_guid":"76JE45SH6FJAMUMKZAFLD3GPVE","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694_c-7732949b-a651-32d4-a1f7-7b90735e56f6_a-076054a6-7d27-3087-8a3b-c2b26079dd7c","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/finance\/harley-davidson-dying-brand-60da3zl","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"24\/7 Wall St.","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/harley-davidson-dying-brand-144008282.html","img":null,"title":"Is Harley-Davidson a Dying Brand?","summary":"With its global motorcycle sales continuing to slide and with younger buyers not seeking out the Harley-Davidson brand, it seems fair to wonder if the company is in trouble for the long term.","published_at":1508239043,"content_id":"076054a6-7d27-3087-8a3b-c2b26079dd7c","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/harley-davidson-dying-brand-144008282.html","content_published_at":1508251208,"content_relative_time":9,"vibe_name":"Finance","vibe_id":"338950e1-cae3-359e-bfa3-af403b69d694"},"created_at":1508261585,"comment_relative_time":6,"bot":false},{"text":"Ben Bernanke created gold by hitting the Print button at the Federal Reserve","message_id":"0e0997c6-24e4-47e2-9cb9-d57088a9386b","context_id":"4a0d27ed-314c-3850-9956-0051ac609960","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Freddy","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_F_jl.jpg","author_guid":"S4VN32FZKM7BH5HQLDFQ2NFIJ4","score":0.24725712712079,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-73414143-4d77-3417-8aad-600f34787402_a-4a0d27ed-314c-3850-9956-0051ac609960","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/astronomy\/v-28d52c31-89c5-330f-9d52-61eec9fa77cc_c-73414143-4d77-3417-8aad-600f34787402_a-4a0d27ed-314c-3850-9956-0051ac609960","author":"nanook","provider":"LiveScience.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/first-detection-gravitational-waves-neutron-141800120.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/livescience.com\/882f174de6156bbd8e28e66477ac7b16","title":"First Detection of Gravitational Waves from Neutron-Star Crash Marks New Era of Astronomy","summary":"A new era of astronomy has begun.

That's the conclusion from Monday's announcement of gravitational wave signal GW170817. It is another reminder that we are intimately connected to the cosmos around us. At heart, astronomy is not really about remote and abstracted realms, instead it informs us about our own origins and the origins of those things we value. Astronomically, the origin of gold has been a puzzle for decades.
