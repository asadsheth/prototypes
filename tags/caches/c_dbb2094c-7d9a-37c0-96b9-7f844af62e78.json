Warning that he might ultimately terminate the agreement, Trump's move was a major change in U.S. foreign policy at a time when his administration is also in a crisis with North Korea over that country's nuclear ambitions. It was the second time in two days that Trump took aim at the legacy of his predecessor Barack Obama after signing an executive order on Thursday to weaken the Democratic former president's signature healthcare reform.","published_at":1507924838,"content_id":"4c57fd6a-7d75-3107-8971-31e3f9178bb8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/president-trump-decertify-iran-nuclear-deal-major-shift-153624871.html","content_published_at":1507933038,"content_relative_time":0,"vibe_name":"Politics","vibe_id":"dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78"},"created_at":1507917874,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":false},{"text":"Why don't we call these payments subsidies to insurance companies?","message_id":"281cda65-e4b6-4c46-a3ee-b982a01fb9b7","context_id":"7b5d7620-f100-3ee2-becf-7a53fbbb63fa","upvotes":37,"downvotes":14,"reports":0,"replies":6,"author_name":"John","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"6E3ZBZBHZJ42YIAQLIGLT6S2XI","score":0.73618608813887,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-3e5e5052-3b9d-3016-aa65-3cd1ce29b49f_a-7b5d7620-f100-3ee2-becf-7a53fbbb63fa","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/politics\/trump-repeating-obamas-mistake-health-care-reverse-ebi0we7","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Yahoo Finance","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-repeating-obamas-mistake-health-care-reverse-202032546.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-10-13\/db09dc90-b023-11e7-90df-d102b2dfaf2b_AP_17285602521748.jpg","title":"Trump is repeating Obama's mistake on health care, in reverse","summary":"President Donald Trump has signed off on an executive order that would loosen rules on insurers, allowing them to offer \u201cskimpy\u201d health plans that would cover less but also cost less.

Warning that he might ultimately terminate the agreement, Trump's move was a major change in U.S. foreign policy at a time when his administration is also in a crisis with North Korea over that country's nuclear ambitions. It was the second time in two days that Trump took aim at the legacy of his predecessor Barack Obama after signing an executive order on Thursday to weaken the Democratic former president's signature healthcare reform.","published_at":1507924838,"content_id":"4c57fd6a-7d75-3107-8971-31e3f9178bb8","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/president-trump-decertify-iran-nuclear-deal-major-shift-153624871.html","content_published_at":1507933038,"content_relative_time":0,"vibe_name":"Politics","vibe_id":"dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78"},"created_at":1507917011,"comment_relative_time":5,"bot":false},{"text":"Look, Iran it's terrorist proxy Hezbollah can inflict some painful casualties on Israel.

So, I think I can look at this objectively. A lot of people on the ACA voted for Republican Trump. So, it's hard to feel sorry for them, as they chose to be low-information voters. But,  I do feel badly for those on the ACA who did not vote for Trump. Hopefully, they won't be in any catastrophic accident or get a disease like cancer. Those would be heart-breaking situations. All that people impacted by Trump's actions can do is to be sure to vote on November 2018 and November 2020. But, next time, make yourself an INFORMED voter. Ignore what you THINK is being done for other people. Dig deeper and vote for who is on your side. Republican Trump's average job approval rating is at 37.7%. There's a political tsunami on the horizon.","message_id":"380556e8-59d2-4466-a601-e949e3f10691","context_id":"7b5d7620-f100-3ee2-becf-7a53fbbb63fa","upvotes":84,"downvotes":47,"reports":0,"replies":33,"author_name":"Anonymous","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_Y_jl.jpg","author_guid":"5CZ6ZT6DZIGYI63VQ4GCHSOF7Q","score":0.6693456804383,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-3e5e5052-3b9d-3016-aa65-3cd1ce29b49f_a-7b5d7620-f100-3ee2-becf-7a53fbbb63fa","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/politics\/trump-repeating-obamas-mistake-health-care-reverse-ebi0we7","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Yahoo Finance","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-repeating-obamas-mistake-health-care-reverse-202032546.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-10-13\/db09dc90-b023-11e7-90df-d102b2dfaf2b_AP_17285602521748.jpg","title":"Trump is repeating Obama's mistake on health care, in reverse","summary":"President Donald Trump has signed off on an executive order that would loosen rules on insurers, allowing them to offer \u201cskimpy\u201d health plans that would cover less but also cost less.

I paid a reasonable amount for my insurance (no subsidies - I make enough to take care of my own needs).\n\nNow, all of that is history because of Republican actions.

The FEMA Twitter feeds and DOD videos on YouTube show progress being made in PR and USVI, but they don't want to share that. I'm also concerned with the paper towel incident and how some networks decided to leave out the context, which showed people passing supplies to people behind them and how Trump was simply tossing towels to people in the back who had their hands up. Last but not least, some networks chose not to report on Harvey Weinstein at first. You are being fed the story lines, facts and snippets of videos that they want to share with you in order to tell the story that they want you to believe. I call that Fake News.
