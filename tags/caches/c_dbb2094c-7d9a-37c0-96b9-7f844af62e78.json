The coal industry is a shadow of what it once was due to the enormous drawbacks of coal - pollution, health effects, antiquated safety laws, and overall one of the most dangerous jobs in the USA. \n\nAnd experts have pointed out, the coal industry has no chance of ever coming back due to several factors some of which have been cited above. \n\nthe coal industry employed 76,572 people in 2014, the latest year for which data is available.  That might sound like alot..except that the bowling (69,088) and skiing (75,036) industries are about the same.  Other dwindling industries, such as travel agencies (99,888 people), employ considerably more. Used-car dealerships provide 138,000 jobs. Theme parks provide nearly 144,000. Carwash employment tops 150,000.\n\nHeck even Arby's employs more people than the ENTIRE coal industry. \n\nBluntly put, the coal industry is on the decline.  Just like Sears and Roebuck...both are relics of a past era.","id":"df71bed5-e4ee-48ea-babe-054b47966ddb","context_id":"4ca558fd-0ec6-3be5-8fb4-bb4180518a5a","upvotes":66,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":4,"author_name":"aj","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/e75ae2a0ea082abb74a4b57e19828885_192.png","score":0.92992247436187,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-1b5069fa-adb9-30c7-b64f-14d1853faf48_a-4ca558fd-0ec6-3be5-8fb4-bb4180518a5a","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/politics\/donald-trump-extols-tax-reform-66n0hhp","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/donald-trump-extols-tax-reform-221029874.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/video\/video.cbsphiladelphia.com\/86ef6fd929cf79c2ffa7ccaea3798e22","title":"Donald Trump Extols A Tax Reform Plan With A Deficit Of Facts","summary":"President Donald Trump\u00a0hit the road again Wednesday to sell his tax proposal and, once again, relied on false statements to make the case.","published_at":1507759829,"content_id":"4ca558fd-0ec6-3be5-8fb4-bb4180518a5a","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/donald-trump-extols-tax-reform-221029874.html","content_published_at":1507759829,"content_relative_time":17,"vibe_name":"Politics"},"created_at":1507765384,"comment_relative_time":16,"bot":false},{"text":"If Obama can force everyone to get health insurance, then the NFL owners can surely make their teams stand for the National Anthem!","id":"1c5c6524-eb91-412b-b3d7-e08e77f9f007","context_id":"e6432066-deb5-3943-850d-e424b39de164","upvotes":446,"downvotes":38,"reports":0,"replies":14,"author_name":"brad","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_B_mr.jpg","score":0.92712904662965,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-d2235882-981c-3a19-b1e4-ae242856485e_a-e6432066-deb5-3943-850d-e424b39de164","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/politics\/v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-d2235882-981c-3a19-b1e4-ae242856485e_a-e6432066-deb5-3943-850d-e424b39de164","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Shutdown Corner","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/labor-union-challenges-jerry-jones-stand-anthem-mandate-125336791.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/2dbbd3065b5441e6693694c594f55948","title":"Labor union challenges Jerry Jones' stand-for-anthem mandate","summary":"A labor union is challenging Jerry Jones' decree that players must stand for the national anthem.","published_at":1507740065,"content_id":"e6432066-deb5-3943-850d-e424b39de164","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/labor-union-challenges-jerry-jones-stand-anthem-mandate-125336791.html","content_published_at":1507726416,"content_relative_time":26,"vibe_name":"Politics"},"created_at":1507729847,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":false},{"text":"Hilarious, all this support for a man who BEAT his wife...maybe lebron can have eminem and weinstein over for dinner.........","id":"2465c11d-0824-4e2d-a50b-1f6805b4d493","context_id":"8b572bf3-f6a5-3827-adc0-14fe6aabcbdc","upvotes":102,"downvotes":7,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Jason","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","score":0.92613112952847,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-6c81d619-a15a-3c79-8c63-7d64be5ab1ed_a-8b572bf3-f6a5-3827-adc0-14fe6aabcbdc","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/politics\/v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-6c81d619-a15a-3c79-8c63-7d64be5ab1ed_a-8b572bf3-f6a5-3827-adc0-14fe6aabcbdc","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"AOL.com","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/lebron-james-colin-kaepernick-perfect-130720459.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/aol_com_127\/92132d4bad7bf05a67bd807878358951","title":"LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick have perfect reactions to Eminem's lethal Trump cypher","summary":"Rapper Eminem aimed a devastating\u00a0blow at President Trump during the BET Hip Hop Awards on Tuesday\u00a0night.","published_at":1507777639,"content_id":"8b572bf3-f6a5-3827-adc0-14fe6aabcbdc","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/lebron-james-colin-kaepernick-perfect-130720459.html","content_published_at":1507727240,"content_relative_time":26,"vibe_name":"Politics"},"created_at":1507732737,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":false},{"text":"Donald Trump, who doesn't know much about history, is just repeating the late Vice President Spiro Agnew's attacks on the press.
