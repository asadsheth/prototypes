The Mayor of San Juan was pleading for the people outside San Juan, those who are dying, literally for lack of clean water and medicine while FEMA shows up with Paperwork instead of Supplies and demands people with no access to fuel, no ability to transport the stuff go get the supplies themselves once the paperwork is approved.
