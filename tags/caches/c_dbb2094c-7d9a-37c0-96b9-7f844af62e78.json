At one time or another we've all played a game of Monopoly, right?

In my opinion this is why we have\/need an estate tax, so that a couple of dozen families in the US don't literally end up being trillionaires and owning the whole country while 300 million of us become indentured servants. Also, a big talking point of the right wingers is that the estate tax is theft because the money has been taxed already. If you do just a few minutes of research you will find out that this is not necessarily true, Do not let them get away with this false talking point.","id":"1a05781d-9a71-4854-b451-8caa9035f834","context_id":"3afb4205-490d-3096-8d67-9a253f4a0b11","upvotes":689,"downvotes":137,"reports":0,"replies":90,"author_name":"J R","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","score":0.84520200158535,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-d3e5b68b-62ee-3fbd-87a1-2c82bb949c9b_a-3afb4205-490d-3096-8d67-9a253f4a0b11","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/politics\/trump-enlist-truckers-help-sell-tax-plan-4p59slu","author":"nanook","provider":"Yahoo Finance","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-enlist-truckers-help-sell-tax-plan-101131352.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/e1d37e1f5cd4709c38755a7c07a92d6c","title":"Trump to enlist truckers to help sell his tax plan","summary":"President Donald Trump will insist that truckers and other middle-income workers stand to gain bigly from his tax plan.","published_at":1507716691,"content_id":"3afb4205-490d-3096-8d67-9a253f4a0b11","content_url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-enlist-truckers-help-sell-tax-plan-101131352.html","content_published_at":1507716691,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"Politics"},"created_at":1507719034,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":false},{"text":"Look at how these stupid stars and Liberals are ensuring Trump is re-elected in 2020.

The code was established on December 6, 1951. Compliance with the code was indicated by the \"Seal of Good Practice\", displayed during closing credits on most United States television programs, and on some US TV station sign-on and sign-offs from 1952 through the early 1980s.\n\nThe code prohibited the use of profanity, the negative portrayal of family life, irreverence for God and religion, illicit sex, drunkenness and addiction, presentation of cruelty, detailed techniques of crime, the use of horror for its own sake, and the negative portrayal of law enforcement officials, among others. The code regulated how performers should dress and move to be within the \"bounds of decency\". Further, news reporting was to be \"factual, fair and without bias\" and commentary and analysis should be \"clearly defined as such\". Broadcasters were to make time available for religious broadcasting and were discouraged from charging religious bodies for access. Most importantly, it limited the commercial minutes per hour.[1]\n\nIn the wake of a settlement with the Justice Department, the code was suspended in 1983.[2][3][4]\n\nA scholarly discussion titled \"Self-Regulation and the Media\" by Angela J. Campbell, (1999) examines media self-regulation and concludes that \"Applying these five factors to digital television public interest responsibilities and privacy on the Internet, it concludes that self-regulation is NOT likely to be successful in these contexts.\" This is a WELL DOCUMENTED REPORT![5]..Wikipedia....
