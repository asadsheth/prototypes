This latest move comes amid increasing concern over North Korea's military capabilities, with the new US administration upping its rhetoric in response.\u00a0 While the Pyongyang regime increases the frequency with which it is conducting missile tests,\u00a0Donald Trump's defence secretary Jim 'Mad Dog' Mattis\u00a0has previously warned North Korea of an \"effective and overwhelming\"\u00a0response if Pyongyang used nuclear weapons. North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017 Elsewhere, rhetoric hints\u00a0at a return of the expansion of nuclear arsenals across the world.\u00a0In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of defence chiefs that strengthening nuclear capability should be a key objective for 2017. Donald Trump then took to Twitter to respond, vowing to do the same. Such rhetoric has led to concerns about the world's nuclear capacity and the unpredictability of those in charge of the warheads. It seems the world is a long way from \"coming to its senses\" - with millions of kilotons already in military service\u00a0around the world. Between them, the world's nuclear-armed states have around 15,000 warheads - the majority of which belong to the US and Russia. It is estimated that just under 10,000 of these are in military service, with the rest awaiting dismantlement,\u00a0according to the Arms Control Association.\u00a0 Putin says Russia should strengthen its nuclear arsenal 00:51 Which countries have nuclear weapons? There are five nuclear-weapon states in the world:\u00a0China, France, Russia, United Kingdom\u00a0and the United States. These are officially recognised as possessing such weapons by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This treaty acknowledges and legitimises their arsenals, but they are\u00a0not supposed to build or maintain them forever. Indeed, they have committed to eliminate them.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0four other countries that have nuclear weapons: Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. These countries didn't sign the Treaty, and together possess an estimated 340 nuclear weapons.\u00a0 But it's\u00a0Russia and the US that have by far the most in the world - dominating all other countries by collectively sharing 88\u00a0per cent of the world's arsenal of stockpiled nukes. This figure increases to 93 per cent when we consider retired nukes.\u00a0 How the world's 15,000 nukes are divided How deadly could these nuclear weapons be? The world's current collection of 14,900 nuclear weapons possesses enough power to kill millions of people and flatten dozens of cities.\u00a0 According to Telegraph research, it is estimated that the US and Russian arsenals combined have power equating to 6,600\u00a0megatons. This is a tenth of the total solar energy received by Earth every minute. According to the NukeMap website, the dropping of the B-83, the largest bomb in the current US arsenal, would kill 1.4m\u00a0people in the first 24 hours. A further 3.7m people would be injured, as the thermal radiation radius reached 13.km.\u00a0 Likewise, the \"Tsar Bomba\" is the largest USSR bomb tested. If this bomb was dropped on New York, it is estimated that it could kill\u00a07.6m people and injure 4.2m more.\u00a0The nuclear fallout could reach an approximate area of 7,880km on a 15mph wind, impacting millions more people.\u00a0 Both America and Russia's arsenals are regulated by several treaties that place limits on the numbers and kinds of warheads and delivery systems they have. \u00a0 If either country were to expand their nuclear capacity even further, as Trump and Putin have hinted at, it could shatter these agreements and plunge the world into a new Cold War. North Korean missile ranges Our figures on nuclear weapons, based on statistics from the Arms Control Association, are mainly\u00a0estimates\u00a0because of the secretive nature with which most governments treat information about their arsenals.\u00a0","published_at":1507533612,"content_id":"b2da80b6-d638-329c-8996-671ad7918197","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/many-nukes-world-could-destroy-081201868.html","content_published_at":1507533487,"content_relative_time":9,"vibe_name":"Politics"},"created_at":1507073568,"comment_relative_time":137,"bot":false},{"text":"Why did Pelosi attend an event made up of people who shouldn't be voting?

many nukes are in the world and what could they destroy?","summary":"Tensions over nuclear weapons have been raised further after North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. This latest move comes amid increasing concern over North Korea's military capabilities, with the new US administration upping its rhetoric in response.\u00a0 While the Pyongyang regime increases the frequency with which it is conducting missile tests,\u00a0Donald Trump's defence secretary Jim 'Mad Dog' Mattis\u00a0has previously warned North Korea of an \"effective and overwhelming\"\u00a0response if Pyongyang used nuclear weapons. North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017 Elsewhere, rhetoric hints\u00a0at a return of the expansion of nuclear arsenals across the world.\u00a0In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of defence chiefs that strengthening nuclear capability should be a key objective for 2017. Donald Trump then took to Twitter to respond, vowing to do the same. Such rhetoric has led to concerns about the world's nuclear capacity and the unpredictability of those in charge of the warheads. It seems the world is a long way from \"coming to its senses\" - with millions of kilotons already in military service\u00a0around the world. Between them, the world's nuclear-armed states have around 15,000 warheads - the majority of which belong to the US and Russia. It is estimated that just under 10,000 of these are in military service, with the rest awaiting dismantlement,\u00a0according to the Arms Control Association.\u00a0 Putin says Russia should strengthen its nuclear arsenal 00:51 Which countries have nuclear weapons? There are five nuclear-weapon states in the world:\u00a0China, France, Russia, United Kingdom\u00a0and the United States. These are officially recognised as possessing such weapons by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This treaty acknowledges and legitimises their arsenals, but they are\u00a0not supposed to build or maintain them forever. Indeed, they have committed to eliminate them.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0four other countries that have nuclear weapons: Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. These countries didn't sign the Treaty, and together possess an estimated 340 nuclear weapons.\u00a0 But it's\u00a0Russia and the US that have by far the most in the world - dominating all other countries by collectively sharing 88\u00a0per cent of the world's arsenal of stockpiled nukes. This figure increases to 93 per cent when we consider retired nukes.\u00a0 How the world's 15,000 nukes are divided How deadly could these nuclear weapons be? The world's current collection of 14,900 nuclear weapons possesses enough power to kill millions of people and flatten dozens of cities.\u00a0 According to Telegraph research, it is estimated that the US and Russian arsenals combined have power equating to 6,600\u00a0megatons. This is a tenth of the total solar energy received by Earth every minute. According to the NukeMap website, the dropping of the B-83, the largest bomb in the current US arsenal, would kill 1.4m\u00a0people in the first 24 hours. A further 3.7m people would be injured, as the thermal radiation radius reached 13.km.\u00a0 Likewise, the \"Tsar Bomba\" is the largest USSR bomb tested. If this bomb was dropped on New York, it is estimated that it could kill\u00a07.6m people and injure 4.2m more.\u00a0The nuclear fallout could reach an approximate area of 7,880km on a 15mph wind, impacting millions more people.\u00a0 Both America and Russia's arsenals are regulated by several treaties that place limits on the numbers and kinds of warheads and delivery systems they have. \u00a0 If either country were to expand their nuclear capacity even further, as Trump and Putin have hinted at, it could shatter these agreements and plunge the world into a new Cold War. North Korean missile ranges Our figures on nuclear weapons, based on statistics from the Arms Control Association, are mainly\u00a0estimates\u00a0because of the secretive nature with which most governments treat information about their arsenals.\u00a0","published_at":1507533612,"content_id":"b2da80b6-d638-329c-8996-671ad7918197","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/many-nukes-world-could-destroy-081201868.html","content_published_at":1507533487,"content_relative_time":9,"vibe_name":"Politics"},"created_at":1507073568,"comment_relative_time":137,"bot":false},{"text":"Hack BS article !

This latest move comes amid increasing concern over North Korea's military capabilities, with the new US administration upping its rhetoric in response.\u00a0 While the Pyongyang regime increases the frequency with which it is conducting missile tests,\u00a0Donald Trump's defence secretary Jim 'Mad Dog' Mattis\u00a0has previously warned North Korea of an \"effective and overwhelming\"\u00a0response if Pyongyang used nuclear weapons. North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017 Elsewhere, rhetoric hints\u00a0at a return of the expansion of nuclear arsenals across the world.\u00a0In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of defence chiefs that strengthening nuclear capability should be a key objective for 2017. Donald Trump then took to Twitter to respond, vowing to do the same. Such rhetoric has led to concerns about the world's nuclear capacity and the unpredictability of those in charge of the warheads. It seems the world is a long way from \"coming to its senses\" - with millions of kilotons already in military service\u00a0around the world. Between them, the world's nuclear-armed states have around 15,000 warheads - the majority of which belong to the US and Russia. It is estimated that just under 10,000 of these are in military service, with the rest awaiting dismantlement,\u00a0according to the Arms Control Association.\u00a0 Putin says Russia should strengthen its nuclear arsenal 00:51 Which countries have nuclear weapons? There are five nuclear-weapon states in the world:\u00a0China, France, Russia, United Kingdom\u00a0and the United States. These are officially recognised as possessing such weapons by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This treaty acknowledges and legitimises their arsenals, but they are\u00a0not supposed to build or maintain them forever. Indeed, they have committed to eliminate them.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0four other countries that have nuclear weapons: Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. These countries didn't sign the Treaty, and together possess an estimated 340 nuclear weapons.\u00a0 But it's\u00a0Russia and the US that have by far the most in the world - dominating all other countries by collectively sharing 88\u00a0per cent of the world's arsenal of stockpiled nukes. This figure increases to 93 per cent when we consider retired nukes.\u00a0 How the world's 15,000 nukes are divided How deadly could these nuclear weapons be? The world's current collection of 14,900 nuclear weapons possesses enough power to kill millions of people and flatten dozens of cities.\u00a0 According to Telegraph research, it is estimated that the US and Russian arsenals combined have power equating to 6,600\u00a0megatons. This is a tenth of the total solar energy received by Earth every minute. According to the NukeMap website, the dropping of the B-83, the largest bomb in the current US arsenal, would kill 1.4m\u00a0people in the first 24 hours. A further 3.7m people would be injured, as the thermal radiation radius reached 13.km.\u00a0 Likewise, the \"Tsar Bomba\" is the largest USSR bomb tested.

This latest move comes amid increasing concern over North Korea's military capabilities, with the new US administration upping its rhetoric in response.\u00a0 While the Pyongyang regime increases the frequency with which it is conducting missile tests,\u00a0Donald Trump's defence secretary Jim 'Mad Dog' Mattis\u00a0has previously warned North Korea of an \"effective and overwhelming\"\u00a0response if Pyongyang used nuclear weapons. North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017 Elsewhere, rhetoric hints\u00a0at a return of the expansion of nuclear arsenals across the world.\u00a0In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of defence chiefs that strengthening nuclear capability should be a key objective for 2017. Donald Trump then took to Twitter to respond, vowing to do the same. Such rhetoric has led to concerns about the world's nuclear capacity and the unpredictability of those in charge of the warheads. It seems the world is a long way from \"coming to its senses\" - with millions of kilotons already in military service\u00a0around the world. Between them, the world's nuclear-armed states have around 15,000 warheads - the majority of which belong to the US and Russia. It is estimated that just under 10,000 of these are in military service, with the rest awaiting dismantlement,\u00a0according to the Arms Control Association.\u00a0 Putin says Russia should strengthen its nuclear arsenal 00:51 Which countries have nuclear weapons? There are five nuclear-weapon states in the world:\u00a0China, France, Russia, United Kingdom\u00a0and the United States. These are officially recognised as possessing such weapons by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This treaty acknowledges and legitimises their arsenals, but they are\u00a0not supposed to build or maintain them forever. Indeed, they have committed to eliminate them.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0four other countries that have nuclear weapons: Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. These countries didn't sign the Treaty, and together possess an estimated 340 nuclear weapons.\u00a0 But it's\u00a0Russia and the US that have by far the most in the world - dominating all other countries by collectively sharing 88\u00a0per cent of the world's arsenal of stockpiled nukes. This figure increases to 93 per cent when we consider retired nukes.\u00a0 How the world's 15,000 nukes are divided How deadly could these nuclear weapons be? The world's current collection of 14,900 nuclear weapons possesses enough power to kill millions of people and flatten dozens of cities.\u00a0 According to Telegraph research, it is estimated that the US and Russian arsenals combined have power equating to 6,600\u00a0megatons. This is a tenth of the total solar energy received by Earth every minute. According to the NukeMap website, the dropping of the B-83, the largest bomb in the current US arsenal, would kill 1.4m\u00a0people in the first 24 hours. A further 3.7m people would be injured, as the thermal radiation radius reached 13.km.\u00a0 Likewise, the \"Tsar Bomba\" is the largest USSR bomb tested. If this bomb was dropped on New York, it is estimated that it could kill\u00a07.6m people and injure 4.2m more.\u00a0The nuclear fallout could reach an approximate area of 7,880km on a 15mph wind, impacting millions more people.\u00a0 Both America and Russia's arsenals are regulated by several treaties that place limits on the numbers and kinds of warheads and delivery systems they have. \u00a0 If either country were to expand their nuclear capacity even further, as Trump and Putin have hinted at, it could shatter these agreements and plunge the world into a new Cold War.

My daughter wants to be a mermaid. She's 6. They just don't get it. They are to young to get anything about their bodies. I am thankful I was raised back before all of this gender stuff. I was a tomboy. I dressed like a boy. Played sports. Most of my friends were either boys or tomboys like myself. I hated wearing dresses (still do). I feel most comfortable in jeans and a tshirt. But something happened around 16. Boys started to become attractive and I started wearing makeup and doing my hair. These young children will go through similar changes if we leave them alone and stop forcing hormones down their throat. It's the adults making big deals of gender rolls. If a boy would rather dance than play sports it doesn't mean he should be a girl. There are a lot of very manly men that dance. And if a girl would rather play with matchbox cars and dinosaurs rather than Barbie dolls doesn't mean she should be a boy. It's when we as adults start telling kids they can't do something because they are one gender or the other that makes them want to be different. If my parents at 6 years old told me I had to wear dresses and I wasn't allowed to go fishing because I'm a girl I would have demanded I wanted to be a boy. I'm glad they accepted me for me, because I'm happy with who I am. I like to fish, go camping, play sports, wear tshirts and sneakers.

This latest move comes amid increasing concern over North Korea's military capabilities, with the new US administration upping its rhetoric in response.\u00a0 While the Pyongyang regime increases the frequency with which it is conducting missile tests,\u00a0Donald Trump's defence secretary Jim 'Mad Dog' Mattis\u00a0has previously warned North Korea of an \"effective and overwhelming\"\u00a0response if Pyongyang used nuclear weapons. North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017 Elsewhere, rhetoric hints\u00a0at a return of the expansion of nuclear arsenals across the world.\u00a0In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of defence chiefs that strengthening nuclear capability should be a key objective for 2017. Donald Trump then took to Twitter to respond, vowing to do the same. Such rhetoric has led to concerns about the world's nuclear capacity and the unpredictability of those in charge of the warheads. It seems the world is a long way from \"coming to its senses\" - with millions of kilotons already in military service\u00a0around the world. Between them, the world's nuclear-armed states have around 15,000 warheads - the majority of which belong to the US and Russia. It is estimated that just under 10,000 of these are in military service, with the rest awaiting dismantlement,\u00a0according to the Arms Control Association.\u00a0 Putin says Russia should strengthen its nuclear arsenal 00:51 Which countries have nuclear weapons? There are five nuclear-weapon states in the world:\u00a0China, France, Russia, United Kingdom\u00a0and the United States. These are officially recognised as possessing such weapons by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This treaty acknowledges and legitimises their arsenals, but they are\u00a0not supposed to build or maintain them forever. Indeed, they have committed to eliminate them.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0four other countries that have nuclear weapons: Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. These countries didn't sign the Treaty, and together possess an estimated 340 nuclear weapons.\u00a0 But it's\u00a0Russia and the US that have by far the most in the world - dominating all other countries by collectively sharing 88\u00a0per cent of the world's arsenal of stockpiled nukes. This figure increases to 93 per cent when we consider retired nukes.\u00a0 How the world's 15,000 nukes are divided How deadly could these nuclear weapons be? The world's current collection of 14,900 nuclear weapons possesses enough power to kill millions of people and flatten dozens of cities.\u00a0 According to Telegraph research, it is estimated that the US and Russian arsenals combined have power equating to 6,600\u00a0megatons. This is a tenth of the total solar energy received by Earth every minute. According to the NukeMap website, the dropping of the B-83, the largest bomb in the current US arsenal, would kill 1.4m\u00a0people in the first 24 hours. A further 3.7m people would be injured, as the thermal radiation radius reached 13.km.\u00a0 Likewise, the \"Tsar Bomba\" is the largest USSR bomb tested. If this bomb was dropped on New York, it is estimated that it could kill\u00a07.6m people and injure 4.2m more.\u00a0The nuclear fallout could reach an approximate area of 7,880km on a 15mph wind, impacting millions more people.\u00a0 Both America and Russia's arsenals are regulated by several treaties that place limits on the numbers and kinds of warheads and delivery systems they have. \u00a0 If either country were to expand their nuclear capacity even further, as Trump and Putin have hinted at, it could shatter these agreements and plunge the world into a new Cold War.

This latest move comes amid increasing concern over North Korea's military capabilities, with the new US administration upping its rhetoric in response.\u00a0 While the Pyongyang regime increases the frequency with which it is conducting missile tests,\u00a0Donald Trump's defence secretary Jim 'Mad Dog' Mattis\u00a0has previously warned North Korea of an \"effective and overwhelming\"\u00a0response if Pyongyang used nuclear weapons. North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017 Elsewhere, rhetoric hints\u00a0at a return of the expansion of nuclear arsenals across the world.\u00a0In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of defence chiefs that strengthening nuclear capability should be a key objective for 2017. Donald Trump then took to Twitter to respond, vowing to do the same. Such rhetoric has led to concerns about the world's nuclear capacity and the unpredictability of those in charge of the warheads. It seems the world is a long way from \"coming to its senses\" - with millions of kilotons already in military service\u00a0around the world. Between them, the world's nuclear-armed states have around 15,000 warheads - the majority of which belong to the US and Russia. It is estimated that just under 10,000 of these are in military service, with the rest awaiting dismantlement,\u00a0according to the Arms Control Association.\u00a0 Putin says Russia should strengthen its nuclear arsenal 00:51 Which countries have nuclear weapons? There are five nuclear-weapon states in the world:\u00a0China, France, Russia, United Kingdom\u00a0and the United States. These are officially recognised as possessing such weapons by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This treaty acknowledges and legitimises their arsenals, but they are\u00a0not supposed to build or maintain them forever. Indeed, they have committed to eliminate them.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0four other countries that have nuclear weapons: Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. These countries didn't sign the Treaty, and together possess an estimated 340 nuclear weapons.\u00a0 But it's\u00a0Russia and the US that have by far the most in the world - dominating all other countries by collectively sharing 88\u00a0per cent of the world's arsenal of stockpiled nukes. This figure increases to 93 per cent when we consider retired nukes.\u00a0 How the world's 15,000 nukes are divided How deadly could these nuclear weapons be? The world's current collection of 14,900 nuclear weapons possesses enough power to kill millions of people and flatten dozens of cities.\u00a0 According to Telegraph research, it is estimated that the US and Russian arsenals combined have power equating to 6,600\u00a0megatons. This is a tenth of the total solar energy received by Earth every minute. According to the NukeMap website, the dropping of the B-83, the largest bomb in the current US arsenal, would kill 1.4m\u00a0people in the first 24 hours. A further 3.7m people would be injured, as the thermal radiation radius reached 13.km.\u00a0 Likewise, the \"Tsar Bomba\" is the largest USSR bomb tested.

This latest move comes amid increasing concern over North Korea's military capabilities, with the new US administration upping its rhetoric in response.\u00a0 While the Pyongyang regime increases the frequency with which it is conducting missile tests,\u00a0Donald Trump's defence secretary Jim 'Mad Dog' Mattis\u00a0has previously warned North Korea of an \"effective and overwhelming\"\u00a0response if Pyongyang used nuclear weapons. North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017 Elsewhere, rhetoric hints\u00a0at a return of the expansion of nuclear arsenals across the world.\u00a0In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of defence chiefs that strengthening nuclear capability should be a key objective for 2017. Donald Trump then took to Twitter to respond, vowing to do the same. Such rhetoric has led to concerns about the world's nuclear capacity and the unpredictability of those in charge of the warheads. It seems the world is a long way from \"coming to its senses\" - with millions of kilotons already in military service\u00a0around the world. Between them, the world's nuclear-armed states have around 15,000 warheads - the majority of which belong to the US and Russia. It is estimated that just under 10,000 of these are in military service, with the rest awaiting dismantlement,\u00a0according to the Arms Control Association.\u00a0 Putin says Russia should strengthen its nuclear arsenal 00:51 Which countries have nuclear weapons? There are five nuclear-weapon states in the world:\u00a0China, France, Russia, United Kingdom\u00a0and the United States. These are officially recognised as possessing such weapons by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This treaty acknowledges and legitimises their arsenals, but they are\u00a0not supposed to build or maintain them forever. Indeed, they have committed to eliminate them.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0four other countries that have nuclear weapons: Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. These countries didn't sign the Treaty, and together possess an estimated 340 nuclear weapons.\u00a0 But it's\u00a0Russia and the US that have by far the most in the world - dominating all other countries by collectively sharing 88\u00a0per cent of the world's arsenal of stockpiled nukes. This figure increases to 93 per cent when we consider retired nukes.\u00a0 How the world's 15,000 nukes are divided How deadly could these nuclear weapons be? The world's current collection of 14,900 nuclear weapons possesses enough power to kill millions of people and flatten dozens of cities.\u00a0 According to Telegraph research, it is estimated that the US and Russian arsenals combined have power equating to 6,600\u00a0megatons. This is a tenth of the total solar energy received by Earth every minute. According to the NukeMap website, the dropping of the B-83, the largest bomb in the current US arsenal, would kill 1.4m\u00a0people in the first 24 hours. A further 3.7m people would be injured, as the thermal radiation radius reached 13.km.\u00a0 Likewise, the \"Tsar Bomba\" is the largest USSR bomb tested. If this bomb was dropped on New York, it is estimated that it could kill\u00a07.6m people and injure 4.2m more.\u00a0The nuclear fallout could reach an approximate area of 7,880km on a 15mph wind, impacting millions more people.\u00a0 Both America and Russia's arsenals are regulated by several treaties that place limits on the numbers and kinds of warheads and delivery systems they have. \u00a0 If either country were to expand their nuclear capacity even further, as Trump and Putin have hinted at, it could shatter these agreements and plunge the world into a new Cold War.

This latest move comes amid increasing concern over North Korea's military capabilities, with the new US administration upping its rhetoric in response.\u00a0 While the Pyongyang regime increases the frequency with which it is conducting missile tests,\u00a0Donald Trump's defence secretary Jim 'Mad Dog' Mattis\u00a0has previously warned North Korea of an \"effective and overwhelming\"\u00a0response if Pyongyang used nuclear weapons. North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017 Elsewhere, rhetoric hints\u00a0at a return of the expansion of nuclear arsenals across the world.\u00a0In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of defence chiefs that strengthening nuclear capability should be a key objective for 2017. Donald Trump then took to Twitter to respond, vowing to do the same. Such rhetoric has led to concerns about the world's nuclear capacity and the unpredictability of those in charge of the warheads. It seems the world is a long way from \"coming to its senses\" - with millions of kilotons already in military service\u00a0around the world. Between them, the world's nuclear-armed states have around 15,000 warheads - the majority of which belong to the US and Russia. It is estimated that just under 10,000 of these are in military service, with the rest awaiting dismantlement,\u00a0according to the Arms Control Association.\u00a0 Putin says Russia should strengthen its nuclear arsenal 00:51 Which countries have nuclear weapons? There are five nuclear-weapon states in the world:\u00a0China, France, Russia, United Kingdom\u00a0and the United States. These are officially recognised as possessing such weapons by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This treaty acknowledges and legitimises their arsenals, but they are\u00a0not supposed to build or maintain them forever. Indeed, they have committed to eliminate them.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0four other countries that have nuclear weapons: Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. These countries didn't sign the Treaty, and together possess an estimated 340 nuclear weapons.\u00a0 But it's\u00a0Russia and the US that have by far the most in the world - dominating all other countries by collectively sharing 88\u00a0per cent of the world's arsenal of stockpiled nukes. This figure increases to 93 per cent when we consider retired nukes.\u00a0 How the world's 15,000 nukes are divided How deadly could these nuclear weapons be? The world's current collection of 14,900 nuclear weapons possesses enough power to kill millions of people and flatten dozens of cities.\u00a0 According to Telegraph research, it is estimated that the US and Russian arsenals combined have power equating to 6,600\u00a0megatons. This is a tenth of the total solar energy received by Earth every minute. According to the NukeMap website, the dropping of the B-83, the largest bomb in the current US arsenal, would kill 1.4m\u00a0people in the first 24 hours. A further 3.7m people would be injured, as the thermal radiation radius reached 13.km.\u00a0 Likewise, the \"Tsar Bomba\" is the largest USSR bomb tested. If this bomb was dropped on New York, it is estimated that it could kill\u00a07.6m people and injure 4.2m more.\u00a0The nuclear fallout could reach an approximate area of 7,880km on a 15mph wind, impacting millions more people.\u00a0 Both America and Russia's arsenals are regulated by several treaties that place limits on the numbers and kinds of warheads and delivery systems they have. \u00a0 If either country were to expand their nuclear capacity even further, as Trump and Putin have hinted at, it could shatter these agreements and plunge the world into a new Cold War.

But they aren't as bad as you imagine.  They are really bad, but not as bad as you imagine.\n\nI did the math the other day, and I assumed in my math that EVERY nuclear weapons we had here in the U.S. was the B83, which they are not and that its 50% destruction and kill radius was instead actually a 100% destruction and kill radius.  This exploded the damage they could theoretically do to give the benefit of the doubt to the idiot I was talking to, the benefit of the doubt did not help him, by the way.\n\nIt would take our entire arsenal to kill every human in North Korea, every single last nuclear weapon we have.

North Korea is smaller than North Carolina, not by much, but smaller nonetheless.  \n\nSo it would take our entire nuclear arsenal, the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, I will remind you, to completely destroy JUST North Carolina.  Again, JUST North Carolina.\n\nHowever, the fallout from such an act would be absolutely devastating.\n\nBut that will never happen, it will never happen to us at the hands of our enemies and it will never happen to one of our enemies at our hands.\n\n\"Why not?\", You may ask?  Because, that would leave either party COMPLETELY defenseless.  And nobody will use even ONE, because the use of one is the exact same as using them all, as once one is used, the rest will surely follow.\n\nSo you can sleep easy tonight knowing for a fact that you will not die due to nuclear weapon.","id":"46e21603-9479-41e8-baba-95ab32f16fc5","context_id":"b2da80b6-d638-329c-8996-671ad7918197","upvotes":3,"downvotes":4,"reports":0,"replies":5,"author_name":"Wes","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_W_jd.jpg","score":0.43332396417969,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-dbb2094c-7d9a-37c0-96b9-7f844af62e78_c-22233d82-8e7c-32d3-a03f-e00c19f98fcf_a-b2da80b6-d638-329c-8996-671ad7918197","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/politics\/many-nukes-world-could-destroy-63mg6kh","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/many-nukes-world-could-destroy-081201868.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/f74a5c5705f91e500c812f71e640c3ab","title":"How many nukes are in the world and what could they destroy?","summary":"Tensions over nuclear weapons have been raised further after North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb.

There are five nuclear-weapon states in the world:\u00a0China, France, Russia, United Kingdom\u00a0and the United States. These are officially recognised as possessing such weapons by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This treaty acknowledges and legitimises their arsenals, but they are\u00a0not supposed to build or maintain them forever. Indeed, they have committed to eliminate them.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0four other countries that have nuclear weapons: Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. These countries didn't sign the Treaty, and together possess an estimated 340 nuclear weapons.\u00a0 But it's\u00a0Russia and the US that have by far the most in the world - dominating all other countries by collectively sharing 88\u00a0per cent of the world's arsenal of stockpiled nukes. This figure increases to 93 per cent when we consider retired nukes.\u00a0 How the world's 15,000 nukes are divided How deadly could these nuclear weapons be? The world's current collection of 14,900 nuclear weapons possesses enough power to kill millions of people and flatten dozens of cities.\u00a0 According to Telegraph research, it is estimated that the US and Russian arsenals combined have power equating to 6,600\u00a0megatons. This is a tenth of the total solar energy received by Earth every minute. According to the NukeMap website, the dropping of the B-83, the largest bomb in the current US arsenal, would kill 1.4m\u00a0people in the first 24 hours. A further 3.7m people would be injured, as the thermal radiation radius reached 13.km.\u00a0 Likewise, the \"Tsar Bomba\" is the largest USSR bomb tested.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017 Elsewhere, rhetoric hints\u00a0at a return of the expansion of nuclear arsenals across the world.\u00a0In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of defence chiefs that strengthening nuclear capability should be a key objective for 2017. Donald Trump then took to Twitter to respond, vowing to do the same. Such rhetoric has led to concerns about the world's nuclear capacity and the unpredictability of those in charge of the warheads. It seems the world is a long way from \"coming to its senses\" - with millions of kilotons already in military service\u00a0around the world. Between them, the world's nuclear-armed states have around 15,000 warheads - the majority of which belong to the US and Russia. It is estimated that just under 10,000 of these are in military service, with the rest awaiting dismantlement,\u00a0according to the Arms Control Association.\u00a0 Putin says Russia should strengthen its nuclear arsenal 00:51 Which countries have nuclear weapons? There are five nuclear-weapon states in the world:\u00a0China, France, Russia, United Kingdom\u00a0and the United States. These are officially recognised as possessing such weapons by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This treaty acknowledges and legitimises their arsenals, but they are\u00a0not supposed to build or maintain them forever. Indeed, they have committed to eliminate them.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0four other countries that have nuclear weapons: Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. These countries didn't sign the Treaty, and together possess an estimated 340 nuclear weapons.\u00a0 But it's\u00a0Russia and the US that have by far the most in the world - dominating all other countries by collectively sharing 88\u00a0per cent of the world's arsenal of stockpiled nukes. This figure increases to 93 per cent when we consider retired nukes.\u00a0 How the world's 15,000 nukes are divided How deadly could these nuclear weapons be? The world's current collection of 14,900 nuclear weapons possesses enough power to kill millions of people and flatten dozens of cities.\u00a0 According to Telegraph research, it is estimated that the US and Russian arsenals combined have power equating to 6,600\u00a0megatons. This is a tenth of the total solar energy received by Earth every minute. According to the NukeMap website, the dropping of the B-83, the largest bomb in the current US arsenal, would kill 1.4m\u00a0people in the first 24 hours. A further 3.7m people would be injured, as the thermal radiation radius reached 13.km.\u00a0 Likewise, the \"Tsar Bomba\" is the largest USSR bomb tested. If this bomb was dropped on New York, it is estimated that it could kill\u00a07.6m people and injure 4.2m more.\u00a0The nuclear fallout could reach an approximate area of 7,880km on a 15mph wind, impacting millions more people.\u00a0 Both America and Russia's arsenals are regulated by several treaties that place limits on the numbers and kinds of warheads and delivery systems they have. \u00a0 If either country were to expand their nuclear capacity even further, as Trump and Putin have hinted at, it could shatter these agreements and plunge the world into a new Cold War.

Indeed, they have committed to eliminate them.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0four other countries that have nuclear weapons: Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. These countries didn't sign the Treaty, and together possess an estimated 340 nuclear weapons.\u00a0 But it's\u00a0Russia and the US that have by far the most in the world - dominating all other countries by collectively sharing 88\u00a0per cent of the world's arsenal of stockpiled nukes.

The world's current collection of 14,900 nuclear weapons possesses enough power to kill millions of people and flatten dozens of cities.\u00a0 According to Telegraph research, it is estimated that the US and Russian arsenals combined have power equating to 6,600\u00a0megatons.
