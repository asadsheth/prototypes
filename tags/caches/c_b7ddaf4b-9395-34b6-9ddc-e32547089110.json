[{"text":"this writer is an idiot.\nWhat Garvey means is that they are playing the game like impatient children. Not manufacturing runs by playing 'small ball', etc. He is calling out millennial weenies for swinging for the fences, expecting immediate gratification, etc.\nAnd by the way , a strikeout is different from a 'regular ' out in many cases. What is a 'regular' out, anyway - just not a strikeout? So, if you strike out with no outs and a man on third, it is no different than a long fly out? Or a sac bunt to move a man along.","message_id":"f5a70905-0197-48b5-a504-e78090589ddc","context_id":"e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","upvotes":6,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"learyj","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_L_jd_3_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"5VTPIXWNKKIOXXGA4M3X6KZN2E","score":0.71911575945596,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-e5c84c07-8f22-3ab7-af63-321f06ea9ef7_a-e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-53ru9ri","author":"nanook","provider":"Big League Stew","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-074225129.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/f4ab9bfea644312d84345795fb1f768d","title":"Steve Garvey blames Dodgers loss in Game 2 on 'Millennial baseball'","summary":"Those dang Millennials are ruining baseball now according to Dodgers legend Steve Garvey.","published_at":1508998086,"content_id":"e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-074225129.html","content_published_at":1509003745,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1509033079,"comment_relative_time":0,"bot":false},{"text":"My daughter plays highly competitive fastpitch softball.

Kenley is a one inning guy now, getting older, Tong Cingriani works so well and should have been in the game not Morrow, for the Astros teed off on the fast ball guys, but could not hit Maeda or stuff throwers, so Roberts had a bad night managing and we gave one away. Gonna be tough in Houston g=to get two wins.","message_id":"c8cc4346-e0b7-49c7-b298-fe8c350d4c93","context_id":"e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","upvotes":20,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"William","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_W_kl.jpg","author_guid":"V3J2TOBZEWKMUGQOQV3NTSSXJE","score":0.88252744480854,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-e5c84c07-8f22-3ab7-af63-321f06ea9ef7_a-e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-53ru9ri","author":"nanook","provider":"Big League Stew","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-074225129.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/f4ab9bfea644312d84345795fb1f768d","title":"Steve Garvey blames Dodgers loss in Game 2 on 'Millennial baseball'","summary":"Those dang Millennials are ruining baseball now according to Dodgers legend Steve Garvey.","published_at":1508998086,"content_id":"e5050c93-7388-3f64-9a11-b2ef4e3924ea","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/steve-garvey-blames-dodgers-loss-game-2-millennial-baseball-074225129.html","content_published_at":1509003745,"content_relative_time":8,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1509025228,"comment_relative_time":2,"bot":false},{"text":"It's the saber metrics nonsense that has ruined the sport.

I'm now the old guy that cant stand flat brims or crooked hats.  However, Garvey is not wrong in his assessment.  Sure Home Runs are an important part of the game.  Dave Kingman, Dale Murphy, Mark McGuire, and Jose Canseo are all examples of players in the 80's that were known for risk reward fence swinging.  However, taking a few strikes when you are down by two runs is baseball common sense.  Putting the ball in play is indeed better than a strikeout. Always allow your opponent to make the mental or physical error rather than you.  Now, if you have a hitter count go ahead and dig in and hack away.  Otherwise, Garvey is accurate when it comes to playoff baseball.  A perfect example is game 7 of the 2001 world series when the best closer in baseball history (Rivera) blew a save to the base to base Diamondbacks to lose the World series.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508967628,"comment_relative_time":18,"bot":false},{"text":"She will eventually be called ex-wife.","message_id":"0280f662-d6ec-4cd5-9a2d-3a879a190c0c","context_id":"c8489853-a1cd-3e9f-99b0-613bcdde5a60","upvotes":22,"downvotes":13,"reports":0,"replies":7,"author_name":"Jim","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"6I7YKCBTLYPO7RFYGOWFAHDORA","score":0.6468474516974,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-4534ddd3-c75c-33bf-8fa4-911cbd3e8c54_a-c8489853-a1cd-3e9f-99b0-613bcdde5a60","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-4534ddd3-c75c-33bf-8fa4-911cbd3e8c54_a-c8489853-a1cd-3e9f-99b0-613bcdde5a60","author":"nanook","provider":"Popsugar US","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/meghan-markle-marries-prince-harry-231554156.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/popsugar_us_649\/9c553728a8e4341b223efeeca7ac1b2a","title":"If Meghan Markle Marries Prince Harry, Will She Be Called Princess?","summary":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been dating for over a year now, and engagement rumors have been surrounding the pair over the last couple of months.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508950947,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":false},{"text":"STOP THE INSANITY!!!!","message_id":"8640bfa8-a97c-4ea9-a19a-2a6faea09b59","context_id":"c8489853-a1cd-3e9f-99b0-613bcdde5a60","upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"CP","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_C_kl.jpg","author_guid":"BSBI6OF35W452LBBEUFFEP2RBI","score":0.59722425808824,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-4534ddd3-c75c-33bf-8fa4-911cbd3e8c54_a-c8489853-a1cd-3e9f-99b0-613bcdde5a60","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-4534ddd3-c75c-33bf-8fa4-911cbd3e8c54_a-c8489853-a1cd-3e9f-99b0-613bcdde5a60","author":"nanook","provider":"Popsugar US","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/meghan-markle-marries-prince-harry-231554156.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/popsugar_us_649\/9c553728a8e4341b223efeeca7ac1b2a","title":"If Meghan Markle Marries Prince Harry, Will She Be Called Princess?","summary":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been dating for over a year now, and engagement rumors have been surrounding the pair over the last couple of months.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508951790,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-5678abe5-00b8-3a84-818e-93161a96e4ab_a-cea24d92-12a3-33ca-9bc0-22b4c5015b53","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-5678abe5-00b8-3a84-818e-93161a96e4ab_a-cea24d92-12a3-33ca-9bc0-22b4c5015b53","author":"nanook","provider":"Glamour","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.glamour.com\/story\/another-taylor-swift-doppelganger-is-freaking-out-the-internet","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/jzxhmiqNV4fYCccqF3xX5Q--\/dz00NDA5O2g9MjQ4MDt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_cea24d92-12a3-33ca-9bc0-22b4c5015b53--152488526.jpeg","title":"This Student Looks So Much Like Taylor Swift She Gets Mobbed by Fans","summary":"There's some serious witchcraft happening on this woman from England's Instagram right now.

The strict following of Wahhabism version of Islam by the Saudi government has created lot of problems for the whole world.  Better late than never.  Turning towards moderate ideas of Islam will make many terrorist activities disappear which means peace and tranquility in the world, and also it will save lots of innocent lives.  This decision by the Saudi government needs to be applauded by all civilized nations.  The money spent on madrasses to train martyrs will be invested for the welfare of people.  This writer just wonders if other Muslim countries supporting jihadi ideology will take a cue from the Saudis and stop assisting fundamentalists and divert their financial resources towards meaningful channels.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508864110,"comment_relative_time":47,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"Will never happen.

Kuwait isn't Saudi, but the two countries have enough in common that i can assess the plans that the prince is making.  I rate his chance of success as low.  He is squeezed by too many constraints.  He has to get major change before the oil revenue dries up (the world is already starting to turn its back on fossil fuels), which means he needs major change within 30 years or less.  The country has no significant natural resources other than oil, so its only hope will be the hard work and ingenuity of its people.  (Like Singapore, for example.)  But Saudis are not accustomed to hard work, and their education system does not turn out people who are creative and dynamic.  Also, the culture does not encourage innovation.  The religion encourages fatalism and passivity, not a \"can-do\" attitude.  Bringing massive and fundamental change to a culture and to its educational systems is certainly possible - but I don't think it is possible in a mere 30 years.  I think Saudi probably faces a very grim future.","message_id":"9f771861-0ed5-4c1c-b89b-172063ca3b20","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":29,"downvotes":2,"reports":0,"replies":6,"author_name":"Linda Sutherland","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_L_ad.jpg","author_guid":"XBBOAJV4H2TOADM3S36525BTUM","score":0.8759610135884,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-5ed91296-765e-3821-af9f-99123785d7c2_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-5ed91296-765e-3821-af9f-99123785d7c2_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/d631b74dcaf6578e0ef456e029892e0e","title":"Saudi Arabia's crown prince promises to lead his country 'back to moderate Islam'","summary":"Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious young crown prince has said he will lead his country back to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d as he announced plans for a vast new \u00a3380 million economic development zone.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed bin Salman told investors gathered in Riyadh that his economic modernisation plans would go hand-in-hand with with political reforms to guide the conservative kingdom away from severe Wahhabi Islam.\u00a0 \"We are returning to what we were before - a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,\" the 32-year-old prince said. \"We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas. We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508875254,"comment_relative_time":44,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"I was there in 1978 to 1980 and I agree with the above !!!","message_id":"9f771861-0ed5-4c1c-b89b-172063ca3b20","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":7,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"rob","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_jd.jpg","score":0.7011628815277,"created_at":1508884489,"comment_relative_time":42,"bot":false}},{"text":"What an ignorant thing to say.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict.

Will everybody's vote count, we have no democracy if not and doesn't matter what side of the isle you are on.","message_id":"7d346bc0-7f3b-43e5-9ad2-9c7cd43f95cf","context_id":"b688a775-16ed-347d-90ac-9cb4b42e4813","upvotes":777,"downvotes":171,"reports":3,"replies":67,"author_name":"Kat","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_K_ald.jpg","author_guid":"SNXWOKWPGKTSVJDKVW43ZMNWLY","score":0.80658220624189,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-5d0f8c47-c329-355f-b47d-9ee4815c00c3_a-b688a775-16ed-347d-90ac-9cb4b42e4813","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/gop-senators-bail-republicans-learning-56w007l","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"HuffPost","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/gop-senators-bail-republicans-learning-015701514.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/the_huffington_post_584\/f24bc0587bc24c4fcf2662e8ced0c0aa","title":"As GOP Senators Bail, Republicans Are Learning What A Trump Party Looks Like","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2015 What does a Party of Donald Trump look like?","published_at":1508886976,"content_id":"b688a775-16ed-347d-90ac-9cb4b42e4813","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/gop-senators-bail-republicans-learning-015701514.html","content_published_at":1508896621,"content_relative_time":38,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508901353,"comment_relative_time":37,"bot":false},{"text":"How will he get rid of the Wahabi \/ Salafi sect of Islam, the main sponsors of radical Islam throughout the Sunni world and the sect that supports the Royal House of Saud?\n\nIt was the deal the House of Saud made with them that put both the House and the sects into prominent positions of power.\n\nIf he can manage to do this without being assassinated \/ murdered, he will bring Islam into the modern world, insha'Allah (if it is the will of Allah)...and such would be a very positive change.","message_id":"5ecd6e4d-4bad-4643-8a04-4da25da38953","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":35,"downvotes":8,"reports":0,"replies":9,"author_name":"William","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/1caf6e0d86e4d779e62457a4e444ed2e_192.jpeg","author_guid":"NBDWPWCSRTLKVVGVSZ3BRZMZQA","score":0.8027700056868,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-5ed91296-765e-3821-af9f-99123785d7c2_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-5ed91296-765e-3821-af9f-99123785d7c2_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/d631b74dcaf6578e0ef456e029892e0e","title":"Saudi Arabia's crown prince promises to lead his country 'back to moderate Islam'","summary":"Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious young crown prince has said he will lead his country back to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d as he announced plans for a vast new \u00a3380 million economic development zone.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed bin Salman told investors gathered in Riyadh that his economic modernisation plans would go hand-in-hand with with political reforms to guide the conservative kingdom away from severe Wahhabi Islam.\u00a0 \"We are returning to what we were before - a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,\" the 32-year-old prince said. \"We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas. We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508877986,"comment_relative_time":43,"bot":false},{"text":"She Loves Big Black C#*ks.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":49,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508888687,"comment_relative_time":40,"bot":false},{"text":"Let me guess, these hats ARE NOT MADE IN AMERICA.

Why would manufacturers want to bring back their factories back if the President does not do it himself?","message_id":"570d5d52-3aee-490a-aa37-230c90cc8ae9","context_id":"daccf8cd-12f3-38e9-9552-89a7ab401f09","upvotes":7,"downvotes":4,"reports":0,"replies":2,"author_name":"Rafy","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_R_ald.jpg","author_guid":"GSYWKH6W5XG4KLZBLKPSEDMKCM","score":0.5947889386344,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-313feb99-420b-37d7-a81d-d6bb25b9288a_a-daccf8cd-12f3-38e9-9552-89a7ab401f09","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-313feb99-420b-37d7-a81d-d6bb25b9288a_a-daccf8cd-12f3-38e9-9552-89a7ab401f09","author":"nanook","provider":"Hello Giggles","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/donald-trump-selling-halloween-maga-170159818.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/hello_giggles_454\/aa94d0728c90bfae08f8d50a7366c12f","title":"Donald Trump is selling Halloween MAGA hats, which is a total disgrace to the holiday and to America","summary":"Donald Trump will likely be one of the most popular costumes you\u2019ll see this Halloween.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia.
