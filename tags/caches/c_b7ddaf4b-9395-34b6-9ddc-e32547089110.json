Come out before the game or at the end of halftime and make speeches, defy the league dress code and wear things during games that promote the cause, start foundations, run media ads, work with the local communities and police departments... the list is endless. But the way they are promoting their cause today is not working.... and will fail. Let me ask a question... Of all the ongoing conversation about the players' protests, how much of it has actually been about how to reduce the number of unjustified police shootings? 5%? 1%? Less than that? But it's not too late. If the players change their approach and take a different path to achieve their good cause, they will find we will be behind them 100%.

The actress, who recently presented alongside Anika Noni Rose at the Emmys, is one of Elle\u2019s\u00a0picks for this year\u2019s\u00a0Women in Hollywood Issue, and her cover is gorgeous. The annual list, which celebrates a number of Hollywood\u2019s trailblazing females, prompted the reveal of seven different cover versions created by the publication. It seems like Tyson\u2019s might be the most popular.
