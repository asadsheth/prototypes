The NFL has quite a quandary on its hands. They can't send out a memo asking players to stop this nonsense and the players can't just suddenly stop it either.  As long as some players genuinely believe that police officers wake up every morning determined to go out and kill black men they have to continue with these 'protests' or its all been a sham.
