We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia.

a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,\" the 32-year-old prince said. \"We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas. We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508934349,"comment_relative_time":8,"bot":false},{"text":"Don't be sorry for the \"haters\" - be sorry for the generation that is growing up watching this garbage.","message_id":"3d3b022b-922f-4d94-ae17-c5f350c5f22d","context_id":"3f99bd87-90fe-3b8f-86ec-3c021a47823e","upvotes":351,"downvotes":3,"reports":0,"replies":9,"author_name":"NoMoreNFL","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/a1e25042de36e6e43a5f13b4fcfd8b80_192.png","author_guid":"Z2YTBAZ7CGZFES7OGGM7S7HQQY","score":0.98573612768649,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-5eb80220-97a4-3907-974d-c0f094ffbf43_a-3f99bd87-90fe-3b8f-86ec-3c021a47823e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/kardashians-continue-e-contract-31l6187","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Deadline","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/kardashians-continue-e-contract-202138410.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/2fd767bedb18c4e4c5877a2e3fdb8778","title":"Kardashians To Continue At E!

The strict following of Wahhabism version of Islam by the Saudi government has created lot of problems for the whole world.  Better late than never.  Turning towards moderate ideas of Islam will make many terrorist activities disappear which means peace and tranquility in the world, and also it will save lots of innocent lives.  This decision by the Saudi government needs to be applauded by all civilized nations.  The money spent on madrasses to train martyrs will be invested for the welfare of people.  This writer just wonders if other Muslim countries supporting jihadi ideology will take a cue from the Saudis and stop assisting fundamentalists and divert their financial resources towards meaningful channels.  I think it will be a good idea if the Saudi government publishes details of its new policy explaining modern Islam - for example, their policy towards stopping Jihadi ideology through mosques and madrasses, equal rights for all genders, freedom of speech and fundamental rights, equal rights for all people practicing different religions etc.","message_id":"b175fa47-ef5b-443a-b2b7-68302ab02054","context_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","upvotes":141,"downvotes":13,"reports":0,"replies":26,"author_name":"Dharam","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ald.jpg","author_guid":"FKP6XRHAQXBOIXHF4FJMTMND6Y","score":0.91511831531243,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-5ed91296-765e-3821-af9f-99123785d7c2_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-5ed91296-765e-3821-af9f-99123785d7c2_a-bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"The Telegraph","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/the_telegraph_258\/d631b74dcaf6578e0ef456e029892e0e","title":"Saudi Arabia's crown prince promises to lead his country 'back to moderate Islam'","summary":"Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambitious young crown prince has said he will lead his country back to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d as he announced plans for a vast new \u00a3380 million economic development zone.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed bin Salman told investors gathered in Riyadh that his economic modernisation plans would go hand-in-hand with with political reforms to guide the conservative kingdom away from severe Wahhabi Islam.\u00a0 \"We are returning to what we were before - a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,\" the 32-year-old prince said. \"We will not spend the next 30 years of our lives dealing with destructive ideas. We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508864110,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"Will never happen.

He has to get major change before the oil revenue dries up (the world is already starting to turn its back on fossil fuels), which means he needs major change within 30 years or less.  The country has no significant natural resources other than oil, so its only hope will be the hard work and ingenuity of its people.  (Like Singapore, for example.)  But Saudis are not accustomed to hard work, and their education system does not turn out people who are creative and dynamic.  Also, the culture does not encourage innovation.  The religion encourages fatalism and passivity, not a \"can-do\" attitude.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia.

Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508870745,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":false},{"text":"So I looked at his attendance record and voting record a whopping 45 percent,  guess they don't need you.","message_id":"576e277b-5d9c-4a21-84d1-fecfc2e0154a","context_id":"8cb8a666-fb00-3aba-aaeb-6f0e5f9c6e50","upvotes":83,"downvotes":17,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"paul","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_P_ad.jpg","author_guid":"SICV2WAQPZ33EOXYCJEBA46QUE","score":0.83670512918946,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-8b4eeaaa-62d2-3638-811f-1b438a1c1d68_a-8cb8a666-fb00-3aba-aaeb-6f0e5f9c6e50","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/arizona-gop-sen-flake-retire-had-tangled-trump-190716974--election-6detfwh","author":"third_watch","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/arizona-gop-sen-flake-retire-had-tangled-trump-190716974--election.html","img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/slick-75759-1508874306197.jpg","title":"GOP Sen.

I had the worst diarrhea of my life a few months ago after eating at Applebee's. I got sick while I was in the mall and it hit very suddenly. The closest toilet was in Sears so I waddled as fast as I could to get to the bathroom before a river of brown erupted from my butt. Alas I discovered that the only bathroom in Sears was on the second floor, so after futilely searching I had to make for the escalator. I could feel the butt-volcano about to erupt, I was frantic. I thought OK, almost there, I can make it, and then I learned that the bathroom was all the way on the far side of the store from the escalator!\n\nThis was bad, really bad. I had my sphincter clenched as tight as I could but I knew I had only seconds left and the bathroom was about half a minute away. If I sprinted I could make it, but if I sprinted I wouldn't be able to properly clench my sphincter. I was stuck. I did the best I could, and I even made it to the bathroom, but before I could get to the stall Mt. Buttuvius erupted in my pants. And it just kept coming. I waddled to the stall with a brown geyser shooting from my bum, got my pants down, and my butt kept spraying like the world's most foul fire hose. It got all over the seat, the toilet, the walls, the floor, there was even some on the ceiling. The CEILING!\n\nI had to pant and breathe deeply but the smell was so bad I almost vomited. So there I was, in Sears, my pants a wet, slimy, nasty brown. The only good thing was that there wasn't anybody in there, and all through my struggle, nobody else came in. I did what I had to do. I used two entire rolls of toilet paper to try to clean up, and I had to try to flush my underwear into the toilet. As you can imagine, this didn't work, so the toilet overflowed and spilled fecal juice all over the bathroom. I used a third roll of toilet paper to try to clean up before giving up. I tied my jacket around my waist to hide the brown stain on the back of my pants and made a hasty yet stealthy retreat, leaving a bathroom ruined with the worst diarrhea in human history in my wake. Thank you for the opportunity to share, and please, share your own stories about fecal distress with others on every story about the Kardashians you see so that others can know our struggle! \"","message_id":"88caba5b-c1c0-4db1-acad-5e53d0a02df5","context_id":"3f99bd87-90fe-3b8f-86ec-3c021a47823e","upvotes":12,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"D","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_mr.jpg","author_guid":"I5HKY76IXQSCYRLIX3NPVFYHBA","score":0.82419738081696,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-5eb80220-97a4-3907-974d-c0f094ffbf43_a-3f99bd87-90fe-3b8f-86ec-3c021a47823e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/kardashians-continue-e-contract-31l6187","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"Deadline","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/kardashians-continue-e-contract-202138410.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-us\/homerun\/deadline.com\/2fd767bedb18c4e4c5877a2e3fdb8778","title":"Kardashians To Continue At E!

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508873989,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":false},{"text":"2006 so she waited 11 years for what reason?  please someone tell me?  oh yeah she had a job to keep and a car payment, NO SYMPATHY for one of these so called alleged abuse claims from any woman unless it happened yesterday all I have to say about it, you kept quiet and cashed your paycheck so I am not interested in hearing 11 years on how you were on your period, give us all a break and shut the mouth please","message_id":"f32ec97b-3141-499d-8a32-406485c06c78","context_id":"80cc8723-6af8-30b5-8bec-92a70f595210","upvotes":759,"downvotes":183,"reports":0,"replies":37,"author_name":"Patrick","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_P_ad.jpg","author_guid":"4P2YAKSBDYZ4I6F7OR6YP7W7KU","score":0.8175618050258,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-9f9ae8b6-7e38-30df-87f0-c6795340e97d_a-80cc8723-6af8-30b5-8bec-92a70f595210","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/former-weinstein-production-assistant-shares-tixyx2a","author":"nanook","provider":"Variety","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/former-weinstein-production-assistant-shares-192736022.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/variety.com\/79a729fee6b79fa7907eb29a87d8af7f","title":"Former Weinstein Production Assistant Shares Graphic Account of Sexual Assault","summary":"Mimi Haleyi \u2014 who formerly worked as a production assistant on a Weinstein Company television series \u2014 is the latest woman to come forward with a sexual assault allegation against Harvey Weinstein, accusing the fallen mogul of forcing himself onto her in 2006, while she was on her period.

Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508872208,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":false},{"text":"The \"Saddest Update\" about him?

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508878081,"comment_relative_time":23,"bot":false},{"text":"They both look like dk heads.","message_id":"d905711c-30d2-4d01-977a-d498d6445eac","context_id":"8d37c8b3-eac2-324d-83bd-f7346ce59f4b","upvotes":20,"downvotes":4,"reports":0,"replies":4,"author_name":"Mike","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_M_jd_2_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"2U6APT5AX5SVC5CO37MBSNWB5U","score":0.78707713710088,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-3bfd2e53-0436-3223-8779-7f0a5942a5d1_a-8d37c8b3-eac2-324d-83bd-f7346ce59f4b","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/twins-identical-people-think-photoshopped-4y6u6gz","author":"third_watch","provider":"Yahoo Style","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/twins-identical-people-think-photoshopped-191123584.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/6c2908cf2aab7c6a7d019c2c665cd94e","title":"These twins are so identical people think they are Photoshopped","summary":"Identical twins Abdullah and Ahmed make the internet question if their uncanny resemblance is real or edited.","published_at":1508872299,"content_id":"8d37c8b3-eac2-324d-83bd-f7346ce59f4b","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/twins-identical-people-think-photoshopped-191123584.html","content_published_at":1508872283,"content_relative_time":25,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508903007,"comment_relative_time":16,"bot":false},{"text":"I think he's more into Halloween than his kid.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508875243,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":false},{"text":"Remember folks, the # 1 cause of divorce is marriage.","message_id":"af20aa83-a2b7-4c85-a4c3-a55fc31a5425","context_id":"b349d512-efea-3c55-8b19-5467b730bbf9","upvotes":11,"downvotes":1,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Abort Liberals","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_AL_jl.jpg","author_guid":"JMQ2DNGHP6PW7RL3XSGELFRNEM","score":0.7765367379658,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-76d4f6d7-9ae5-3460-93e1-a465ebfb7ca9_a-b349d512-efea-3c55-8b19-5467b730bbf9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/fergie-gave-saddest-relationship-josh-49uzgng","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"SheKnows","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/fergie-gave-saddest-relationship-josh-162000844.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-10-24\/3760fb90-b8df-11e7-aed6-7d749dfd9959_SuperFanTV_s2017e211A_Day_FergieWendyWilliams_MASTER-00_00_19_01-Still001.jpg","title":"Fergie Gave the Saddest Relationship Update About Josh Duhamel","summary":"No good thing lasts forever, as Fergie and Josh Duhamel proved when they announced the end of...","published_at":1508862204,"content_id":"b349d512-efea-3c55-8b19-5467b730bbf9","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/fergie-gave-saddest-relationship-josh-162000844.html","content_published_at":1508862000,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508874142,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":false},{"text":"Funny watching the republicans scouring every inch of the Capitol building.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508864077,"comment_relative_time":27,"bot":false},{"text":"Sure this is sad news but it's sickening that she is using the news to promote her album.","message_id":"ef13a78a-4cce-4c85-bca9-87b1e55e34ca","context_id":"b349d512-efea-3c55-8b19-5467b730bbf9","upvotes":18,"downvotes":6,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"Jenny","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"ODWVOYXB4MOXRNYG4BXNJZP5GA","score":0.72674055888244,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-76d4f6d7-9ae5-3460-93e1-a465ebfb7ca9_a-b349d512-efea-3c55-8b19-5467b730bbf9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/fergie-gave-saddest-relationship-josh-49uzgng","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"SheKnows","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/fergie-gave-saddest-relationship-josh-162000844.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-10-24\/3760fb90-b8df-11e7-aed6-7d749dfd9959_SuperFanTV_s2017e211A_Day_FergieWendyWilliams_MASTER-00_00_19_01-Still001.jpg","title":"Fergie Gave the Saddest Relationship Update About Josh Duhamel","summary":"No good thing lasts forever, as Fergie and Josh Duhamel proved when they announced the end of...","published_at":1508862204,"content_id":"b349d512-efea-3c55-8b19-5467b730bbf9","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/fergie-gave-saddest-relationship-josh-162000844.html","content_published_at":1508862000,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508871795,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":false},{"text":"Another snow flake, that does not fit, our desire to Drain The Swamp.","message_id":"ae34f83d-fc73-4650-ba8c-cd8201e6b7c0","context_id":"8cb8a666-fb00-3aba-aaeb-6f0e5f9c6e50","upvotes":147,"downvotes":62,"reports":0,"replies":7,"author_name":"JUAN J","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_J_kl_6-16.jpg","author_guid":"KVYXBD6ILQK2AVMI6WDO4WUF4A","score":0.72598901843243,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-8b4eeaaa-62d2-3638-811f-1b438a1c1d68_a-8cb8a666-fb00-3aba-aaeb-6f0e5f9c6e50","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/arizona-gop-sen-flake-retire-had-tangled-trump-190716974--election-6detfwh","author":"third_watch","provider":"Associated Press","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/arizona-gop-sen-flake-retire-had-tangled-trump-190716974--election.html","img":"https:\/\/slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/slick_thumb\/slick-75759-1508874306197.jpg","title":"GOP Sen.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508872630,"comment_relative_time":25,"bot":false},{"text":"Good move Flakey Jeff......you know you were going to lose trying to be \"McCain-Lite\".

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508888687,"comment_relative_time":20,"bot":false},{"text":"Let me guess, these hats ARE NOT MADE IN AMERICA.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508892059,"comment_relative_time":19,"bot":false},{"text":"How many Iranians are members of ISIS?

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508896502,"comment_relative_time":18,"bot":false},{"text":"For the first time in history a sitting President is making money by selling hats made in China and disrespecting the flag.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508905626,"comment_relative_time":16,"bot":false},{"text":"Flake is correct, his criticism is just.

We will destroy them today,\" he added. \"We will end extremism very soon.\" The prince's pledge is a challenge to Saudi's conservative clerics and came as he announced plans for NEOM, a new economic zone that will stretch across Saudi\u2019s borders into neighboring Egypt and Jordan.\u00a0 The zone will be 26,500km square, making it bigger than Wales and significantly larger than neighbouring Middle Eastern states like Israel, Lebanon or Kuwait.\u00a0 The prince made the announcement at an investor conference in Riyadh Credit: AFP PHOTO \/ FAYEZ NURELDINEFAYEZ NURELDINE\/AFP\/Getty Images The project is the latest announcement from Prince Mohammed, who is pushing aggressively to modernise the kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil as part of his Vision 2030 plan.\u00a0 He laid out a vision of a futuristic economic zone where robots may outnumber humans, drones will carry passengers and omnipresent high-speed internet will be known as \u201cdigital air\u201d.\u00a0 Saudi has announced a string of reforms in recent months, including plans to allow women to drive, but it remains one of the world\u2019s most socially conservative societies.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed\u2019s modernising plans have been applauded by many western leaders but some analysts are sceptical that he will be able to push through economic and political changes on the scale he is talking about. \u00a0 Earlier this year, the royal family backed away from plans to cut benefits for state employees in the face of public anger - a sign of how difficult it may be to reform Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-based economy.\u00a0 Last week, Saudi authorities said they were forming a council of Islamic scholars who would counter violent interpretations of the Koran and the hadith - a set of lessons learned from the life of the prophet Mohammed. The government has also eased restrictions on the use of video messaging applications like Skype and Whatsapp.\u00a0 The investment conference itself was intended as a symbol of modernity and dubbed by some observers as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d. Men and women sat together at the event and it was attended high-profile figures like Tony Blair and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative is something you couldn\u2019t have imagined happening in Saudi Arabia even a few years back,\u201d said Mr Blair, who praised the direction of Prince Mohammed\u2019s reforms.\u00a0 His comments were criticised by Reprieve, a British human rights group, which called Mr Blair\u2019s praise \u201cspectacularly tone deaf\u201d in light of Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record. \u201cThe Saudi government has executed hundreds of people in the past few years \u2013 including protesters and children,\u201d said Maya Foa, Reprieve\u2019s director.\u00a0 Prince Mohammed became heir to the throne in June at the expense of his older cousin, the powerful interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf, who was stripped of his title as crown prince.\u00a0 His father, King Salman, is 81 and in poor health and Prince Mohammed is widely seen as the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. He serves as the country\u2019s defence minister and has wide powers to manage its economy. The prince has led the country\u2019s war in neighboring Yemen, which has seen more than 10,000 people killed. The UN recently blacklisted the Saudi-led military coalition for killing and injuring hundreds of children in the conflict. \u00a0","published_at":1508938518,"content_id":"bbb2b243-8972-3705-a487-2ef4a227dd52","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/saudi-prince-promises-lead-country-150439825.html","content_published_at":1508857479,"content_relative_time":29,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508869755,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":false},{"text":"Duhamel has a tiny peen.","message_id":"50129c77-4042-442b-a351-316a05130216","context_id":"b349d512-efea-3c55-8b19-5467b730bbf9","upvotes":12,"downvotes":15,"reports":0,"replies":7,"author_name":"chris","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_C_mr.jpg","author_guid":"Y6ZNDTFPCON6UTYU3KL347NRJA","score":0.4882429053467,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-76d4f6d7-9ae5-3460-93e1-a465ebfb7ca9_a-b349d512-efea-3c55-8b19-5467b730bbf9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/fergie-gave-saddest-relationship-josh-49uzgng","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"SheKnows","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/fergie-gave-saddest-relationship-josh-162000844.html","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-images\/GLB\/2017-10-24\/3760fb90-b8df-11e7-aed6-7d749dfd9959_SuperFanTV_s2017e211A_Day_FergieWendyWilliams_MASTER-00_00_19_01-Still001.jpg","title":"Fergie Gave the Saddest Relationship Update About Josh Duhamel","summary":"No good thing lasts forever, as Fergie and Josh Duhamel proved when they announced the end of...","published_at":1508862204,"content_id":"b349d512-efea-3c55-8b19-5467b730bbf9","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/fergie-gave-saddest-relationship-josh-162000844.html","content_published_at":1508862000,"content_relative_time":28,"vibe_name":"Celebrity","vibe_id":"b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110"},"created_at":1508868706,"comment_relative_time":26,"bot":false},{"text":"its great but why is a 3 year old obsessed with a rated pg-13 movie??? 3 year olds should not be watching violence like this.
