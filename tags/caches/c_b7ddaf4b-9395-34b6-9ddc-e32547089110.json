You simply can't outlaw that.  But that's not what Ditka is talking about.  He is talking about institutionalized injustice.  Our country's policies addressed all these things in the 60s.  These laws were made primarily by whites (Congress) but were for the benefit of blacks and other minorities.  All the laws, state, federal and local do all they can to prevent institutionalized injustice.  But what most of these protesters want is social change.   They want to be treated better by the individuals they meet from day to day.   The amazing irony of this whole situation is that by protesting in this manner, all they will accomplish is for their race as a whole to be treated worse.  Seriously, how do they expect the average white person to feel when they see a huge crowd of blacks at a BLM demonstration shouting, \"Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon\" ?   Have they ever stopped to think about whether these type of protests will hurt their cause more than it could possibly help it?  If they really wanted to be treated better, the smart thing to do would be to stop these protests, because all they do is create more hatred, and on both sides at that.  People will always generalize.  If some white person sees a violent BLM protest going on, do the people protesting really think those observers are likely to treat them better in the future?  (And not just them, but all the others of their race as well.)  The answer is obvious, but there are a lot of stupid people who cannot comprehend the simplest of concepts.  You want to be treated better, as a whole?  Then simply behave better, as a whole.  When the crime statistics even off between races, I guarantee you will see race relations improved 1000%.  But it could be a long wait.","id":"90534f01-4525-4394-8395-a2f530272f39","context_id":"852fa87b-9a12-3fa0-8b48-03642eca589f","upvotes":384,"downvotes":92,"reports":0,"replies":63,"author_name":"cmg","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_C_kl.jpg","score":0.82074973806233,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-b7ddaf4b-9395-34b6-9ddc-e32547089110_c-6bdd655d-d4e6-3577-bf93-cb0469e7a893_a-852fa87b-9a12-3fa0-8b48-03642eca589f","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/celebrity\/mike-ditka-hasn-t-seen-16psukg","author":"nanook","provider":"ProFootball Talk on NBC Sports","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/mike-ditka-hasn-t-seen-120500826.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-US\/homerun\/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com\/bc0da3bb109159857ffdd88d52a522a4","title":"Mike Ditka hasn\u2019t seen social injustice the last 100 years","summary":"Life must be pretty good, if you\u2019re Mike Ditka.

It's the play calling.  I know what you're thinking it can't be.  But it is.  It's too easy to predict run or pass.

So defenses know this and stopping them is cake.  What they need to do is throw the ball to Chris Johnson who is an ample receiver to keep defenses guessing.
