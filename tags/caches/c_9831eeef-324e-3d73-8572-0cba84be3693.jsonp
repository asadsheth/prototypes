Then, as he was preparing for the biggest home series this year, against India, Chandimal contracted pneumonia, and was out for the first Test. Nominally, he was the captain, of course. He turned up to the press conferences, strode out to the toss, and made all the usual noises about needing to improve in all three areas at the presentations. But Sri Lanka, playing largely as they had under Mathews, had not begun to respond to their new leader.
