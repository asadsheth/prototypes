The Rays know this, Major League Baseball knows this, and the government around Tampa knows this. But stadiums don't appear out of midair; they're the result of a drawn-out, multi-step process. On Tuesday, the first step of that process was reached when Hillsborough County (Fla.) commissioner Ken Hagan announced that a site near downtown Tampa has been acquired, and the intention is to build the Rays a new stadium there. Officials from Hillsborough County, which encompasses Tampa and nearby areas, reached a deal to gain control of roughly 14 acres in the Ybor City-Channel District area near downtown Tampa. The Rays' current home stadium is Tropicana Field, which opened its doors in 1990 and is located in St. Petersburg, roughly 23 miles from the newly proposed site. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled about the possibilities that exist about this location,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cThe site has unlimited potential not only for a state of the art ballpark, but it will also catalyze significant economic development.\u201dA rendering of a potential stadium at the site shows a ballpark squeezed between Channelside Drive on the west and North 15th Street on the east, leaving space for virtually no parking or surrounding attractions.Ybor City is more accessible by public transit than Tropicana Field is, a fact that has made the neighborhood a preferred site for a ball club that has ranked worst or near-worst in attendance in recent years. While site selection is a crucial step toward building a stadium, the Rays' quest for a new home is far from complete. The next and perhaps most difficult step is finding funding for a stadium that is projected to cost roughly $600 million. Tampa Bay isn't the only baseball club looking for a new home; a preferred site for a new stadium aimed at keeping the Athletics in Oakland was announced in September.","published_at":1508896114,"content_id":"64d92661-0316-3cc9-a7a2-709c9ba0c678","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/near-downtown-tampa-selected-potential-224339482.html","content_published_at":1508885019,"content_relative_time":21,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3"},"created_at":1508928868,"comment_relative_time":9,"bot":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-b75b1817-4aac-3fa5-908c-7c757e5c5bf5_a-46557c23-4bef-3c86-b21b-d38195b2303e","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/top-10-most-valuable-sports-3rqducm","author":"nanook","provider":"Investopedia","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/insights\/most-valuable-sports-teams\/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo","img":null,"title":"Top 10 Most Valuable Sports Teams in 2017","summary":"Learn which teams are the most valuable sports franchises in 2017.","published_at":1508937587,"content_id":"46557c23-4bef-3c86-b21b-d38195b2303e","content_url":"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/insights\/most-valuable-sports-teams\/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo","content_published_at":1508937300,"content_relative_time":7,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":7,"bot":true},{"text":"In baseball, you have to produce.

Sure, he struggled over a small sample size but he's been streaky his entire career. Can't justify keeping Joc Pederson over him. I understand that Ethier is swinging a hot bat, Enrique Hernandez is their lefty killer, and Culberson has to be on it due to uncertainties about Seager's health, but keeping Pederson makes no sense. Putting McCarthy, who has barely pitched in the 2nd half, over Pedro Baez or Ryu is another confounding move.","message_id":"2a3b2e21-28d8-4b0f-8f60-43fbebf1463f","context_id":"707fcd74-9e31-39a4-9130-64e6528c4389","upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":1,"author_name":"dagoldeneagle","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/alphatar_100x100_D_ald.jpg","author_guid":"XZGQQ7AC5IXV2MLVJUHPBHF6DU","score":0.52753718344348,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-05816732-eb87-3a38-815c-5bd1f0e09b85_a-707fcd74-9e31-39a4-9130-64e6528c4389","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-05816732-eb87-3a38-815c-5bd1f0e09b85_a-707fcd74-9e31-39a4-9130-64e6528c4389","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Big League Stew","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/dodgers-world-series-roster-curtis-granderson-corey-seager-officially-back-180201619.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/homerun\/feed_manager_auto_publish_494\/b7388653ff8b76f33fdc2737c3f374f3","title":"Dodgers World Series roster: Curtis Granderson out, Corey Seager officially back","summary":"The Dodgers leave veteran outfielder Curtis Granderson off their World Series roster, adding pitcher Brandon McCarthy instead","published_at":1508798305,"content_id":"707fcd74-9e31-39a4-9130-64e6528c4389","content_url":"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/dodgers-world-series-roster-curtis-granderson-corey-seager-officially-back-180201619.html","content_published_at":1508868121,"content_relative_time":26,"vibe_name":"MLB","vibe_id":"aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3"},"created_at":1508876916,"comment_relative_time":24,"bot":false},{"text":"In coming fake News article. \"NewsWeek\" alert.","message_id":"d9ef9e92-0f27-4779-aeff-5d175160d38c","context_id":"84430696-f330-3067-99b8-f82e220767b0","upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"reports":0,"replies":0,"author_name":"bob","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/wv\/images\/c3ac4c1c6b319a96e36db88f14fff0d1_192.jpg","author_guid":"6XQSIQ7RXOGIIBKCMESRMSAS2E","score":0.52753718344348,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-dccb2613-f93e-34a7-8862-596a70df54a7_a-84430696-f330-3067-99b8-f82e220767b0","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/mlb_storylines\/v-aae76c94-9dc9-11e5-a70a-fa163ecf49c3_c-dccb2613-f93e-34a7-8862-596a70df54a7_a-84430696-f330-3067-99b8-f82e220767b0","author":"ipostwhaticareabout","provider":"Newsweek","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/why-2017-world-series-record-163217249.html","img":"http:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en-GB\/homerun\/newsweek_europe_sports_645\/bba725d5fffd3027c36b10f6d58497c8","title":"Why the 2017 World Series Will Be Record-Breaking Before It Even Starts","summary":"The 2017 World Series will begin on Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium when the Houston Astros travel to Los Angeles for Game 1.
