As outlined by Kimberle Crenshaw, intersectionality is not so much something that someone \u201cidentifies\u201d as, but a useful term that easily illustrates certain truths; namely that when multiple forms of oppressions meet, they create new, compound oppressions that are experienced acutely by those who belong to certain marginalised groups. Unmoored from structural analysis, intersectional feminism is fast becoming a shallow buzzword that elevates the individual, stifles dissent, and, most worrying, is being weaponised to silence women of colour.","published_at":1507700027,"content_id":"d7ab069c-9407-3970-b1c6-6cd57f69c321","content_url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2017\/oct\/11\/intersectionality-not-while-feminists-participate-in-pile-ons","content_published_at":1507699221,"content_relative_time":13,"vibe_name":"Feminism"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":13,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-86c832e0-078c-312f-95b9-1e77d1a0b8c6_c-2337c0bd-4ef8-3800-8ce1-2d52167179a9_a-a6e56307-5fd2-379e-b451-d53a74cfe8af","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/feminism\/v-86c832e0-078c-312f-95b9-1e77d1a0b8c6_c-2337c0bd-4ef8-3800-8ce1-2d52167179a9_a-a6e56307-5fd2-379e-b451-d53a74cfe8af","author":"rocky.j.mountain","provider":"IndieWire","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.indiewire.com\/2017\/10\/john-oliver-harvey-weinstein-sexual-abuse-watch-1201885114\/","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/AzCpF8R15BFT0R6F5Kj44g--\/dz0xMjcwO2g9NjY5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_a6e56307-5fd2-379e-b451-d53a74cfe8af-687234873.jpeg","title":"John Oliver Bashes Harvey Weinstein Over 'Horrifying' and 'Infuriating' Sexual Abuse Allegations \u2014 Watch","summary":"Most late night hosts have stayed away from talking about Harvey Weinstein since The New York Times published its report last Thursday on his decades-old history of sexual abuse allegations.
