For you idiots that don't know any better...there was no place to land in the few days after the storm. but Trump has been sending aide to PR and he even did away with the band on jones law so every possible means to get help in to PR was taken..And to be joking about something that horrific just shows what a pathetic show SNL has turned into and how desperate Baldwin is for a job, any kind of job.the mayor of SJ is pleading for help but I have known for a long time that the majority of aide (financially) that goes over there is sucked up by the govt and the head officials. WE need to have leaders over there that will lead for the welfare of their citizens. and that isn't happening now. She needs to get her office in gear and get the local people to all join in and help with the clean up and the coming back from this...AND all of PR need to remember the people that are in the country....they are dying. And from what my friends family said..NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE.... so Instead of making stupid skits to play on SNL why don't you get off your #$%$ and do something good for a change..???

ARRIVALS Runaway Wives and Rogue Feminists: The Origins of the Women's Shelter Movement in Canada, Margo Goodhand Across Canada there are more than 625 shelters for battered and abused women, and by some strange alchemy the first five of them all opened the same year: 1973. Journalist Margo Goodhand sought out the pioneers of the movement to talk of the resistance they faced and the victories they won. Read the Star's review here. Buy it on Amazon here.

Lisa Bloom, 56, is the daughter of another crusading women\u2019s rights lawyer, Gloria Allred. Following in her mother's footsteps, Ms Bloom has set up a legal practice in Los Angeles and represented Mischa Barton in the \u201crevenge porn\u201d case, and comedienne Kathy Griffin, when she sparked fury by posing with a photo of Mr Trump\u2019s severed head. Her Twitter feed is full of support for women\u2019s rights: promoting model Amber Rose\u2019s \u201cslut walk\u201d demanding respect for women regardless of their clothing, and supporting Blac Chyna, the former girlfriend of Rob Kardashian who accused him of abuse. \u201cBig week at The Bloom Firm, fighting sexual harassment, disability rights, race discrimination, rape, wage and hour cases & more,\u201d she tweeted last month. \u201cStay tuned!\u201d The Los Angeles-born lawyer\u2019s decision to represent Weinstein as he handles the fallout from the accusations initially appears surprising. But Ms Bloom was already familiar with Weinstein. In April she announced that he had agreed to turn her book on the Trayvon Martin case in to a television mini-series, with the help of Jay Z. BIG ANNOUNCEMENT: My book SUSPICION NATION is being made into a miniseries, produced by Harvey Weinstein and Jay Z! https:\/\/t.co\/Z4pu7y0TfX\u2014 Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) April 7, 2017 And Weinstein is a long standing Democrat donor; Ms Bloom was a strong campaigner for Hillary Clinton. She has defended her decision to represent the shamed Hollywood mogul, who has apologised for his behaviour. \u201cAs a women\u2019s rights advocate, I have been blunt with Harvey and he has listened to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have told him that times have changed, it is 2017, and he needs to evolve to a higher standard. I have found Harvey to be refreshingly candid and receptive to my message. He has acknowledged mistakes he has made.\u201d Harvey Weinstein When first contacted about the story, Weinstein replied:\u00a0\u201cThe story sounds so good I want to buy the movie rights.\u201d But the following day, with his legal team including Ms Bloom in place, he issued a contrite statement. \u201cI appreciate the way I\u2019ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it. Though I\u2019m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go,\u201d he said. In her own statement, Ms Bloom showed why Weinstein chose her to represent him. \u201cHe wants to reach out to any of the women who may have issues with him to talk to them in a respectful, peaceful way, with me present if that is acceptable to them,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is deeply bothered by his some of his emotional responses.\u00a0 \u201cHe has been working on his temper for over ten years and is chagrined the issue still plagues him. \u201cHe recognises he needs time off to focus on this issue and has much to learn. He wants to reach out to teachers with expertise in this area.\u201d Lisa Bloom, left, with Wendy Walsh - whose accusations of sexual assault toppled Fox News star Bill O'Reilly Her involvement in the case could be seen as a professional risk for someone who has made a name for themselves as the go-to person for women claiming assault. But Ms Bloom was undeterred. \u201cHarvey is not going to demean or attack any of the women making accusations against him, although he does dispute many of the allegations,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, he is going to use this as a painful learning experience to grow into a better man. I will continue to work with him personally for as long as it takes.\u201d She said that Weinstein had asked her \u201cto do a comprehensive review of his company\u2019s policies and practices regarding women in the workplace.\u201d She added: \u201cI will make recommendations to ensure that gender equality and zero tolerance for workplace misconduct aren\u2019t just goals, but a reality.\u201d","published_at":1507247363,"content_id":"34f3fec3-3dcd-314e-b28e-f45f9a9f4299","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/why-famed-women-apos-rights-003642203.html","content_published_at":1507250202,"content_relative_time":159,"vibe_name":"Feminism"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":159,"bot":true},{"text":null,"id":"?","context_id":"?","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-86c832e0-078c-312f-95b9-1e77d1a0b8c6_c-ca13376b-4c30-39f1-917e-5df8be507b1c_a-85e10dc4-0e55-30d2-abde-5e79a82d2ab9","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/feminism\/nycc-livestream-saturdays-panels-walking-36fu52r","author":"third_watch","provider":"Collider","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/collider.com\/nycc-saturday-panels-watch-online\/","img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/Pso3YVvA3_i548S3LtdbJg--\/dz05MzU7aD02NTg7dGFnPW9yaWdpbmFsO2FwcGlkPXluZXdz\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_85e10dc4-0e55-30d2-abde-5e79a82d2ab9-1109184587.jpeg","title":"NYCC: Livestream Saturday's Panels for 'Walking Dead', 'Shannara Chronicles', and More","summary":"An eventful\u00a0New York Comic-Con 2017 is in full swing, and Collider is the exclusive livestreaming partner alongside ReedPOP entertainment, which means you can stream a bevy of great NYCC panels live throughout the day today.
