The #BEGOLDEN campaign, which is being launched\u00a0throughout the region, is aimed at fostering goodwill toward one another, especially immigrants, through awareness and education. The campaign's premise that \"immigration is not a political or legal issue \u2013 it's a human and moral issue\" has unified a diverse group of supporters ranging from city officials, businesses and corporate organizations, as well as religious leaders from the Christian, Muslim, Jewish and other interfaith communities. This is a human issue.","published_at":1523896048,"content_id":"cbae6b03-35c3-30ea-9d99-e2e682798437","content_url":"http:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/news\/pr-news-wire\/PRNews_20180416DA64862\/a-fresh-perspective-on-the-immigration-debate.html","content_published_at":1523862000,"content_time":1523862000,"content_relative_time":22,"reaction_count":0,"vibe_name":"Religion","vibe_id":"1867608c-472f-3cfb-8f4a-c77f41f8cc4d","content_type":"link","aspect":null},"created_at":0,"comment_time":22,"comment_relative_time":22,"bot":true,"whitelisted_commenter":false},{"text":null,"message_id":"?","context_id":"fccf0b5b-cd15-3d12-8f72-1f3240664bf4","post_id":"v-1867608c-472f-3cfb-8f4a-c77f41f8cc4d_c-ddf52b41-8e2b-356e-a151-d7b85413f70a_a-fccf0b5b-cd15-3d12-8f72-1f3240664bf4","upvotes":"0","downvotes":"0","reports":"0","replies":"0","author_name":"Newsroom Bot","author_img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ge\/myc\/newsroom_app_icon_ios.png","author_guid":"1","score":0,"context_meta":{"post_id":"v-1867608c-472f-3cfb-8f4a-c77f41f8cc4d_c-ddf52b41-8e2b-356e-a151-d7b85413f70a_a-fccf0b5b-cd15-3d12-8f72-1f3240664bf4","post_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/newsroom\/vibes\/religion\/v-1867608c-472f-3cfb-8f4a-c77f41f8cc4d_c-ddf52b41-8e2b-356e-a151-d7b85413f70a_a-fccf0b5b-cd15-3d12-8f72-1f3240664bf4","author":"DeltaBravo","provider":"Fox News","lead_attribution":"provider","link":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/world\/2018\/04\/16\/us-pastor-on-trial-in-turkey-for-terror-links.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxnews%2Fworld+%28Internal+-+World+Latest+-+Text%29","imgresolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/N4p.RpFrgZaFoDoo_TD45w--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7mKtKlbTf3S5eRL5WUUryg--\/dz0xOTIwO2g9MTMzMTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fccf0b5b-cd15-3d12-8f72-1f3240664bf4-882063144.jpeg","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/BkhoitwNXvJ2Q6_2ufivdA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMzMxO3c9MTkyMDs-\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7mKtKlbTf3S5eRL5WUUryg--\/dz0xOTIwO2g9MTMzMTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fccf0b5b-cd15-3d12-8f72-1f3240664bf4-882063144.jpeg","height":1331,"width":1920,"tag":"original"}],"img":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/7mKtKlbTf3S5eRL5WUUryg--\/dz0xOTIwO2g9MTMzMTt0YWc9b3JpZ2luYWw7YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M-\/http:\/\/streambe.zenfs.com\/streambe\/streambe_fccf0b5b-cd15-3d12-8f72-1f3240664bf4-882063144.jpeg","imgw":1920,"imgh":1331,"title":"US pastor denies terror links, spying in Turkish court","summary":"ALIAGA, Turkey \u2013 \u00a0An American pastor on Monday denied accusations that he aided terror groups or spied against Turkey, speaking at the beginning of his trial in a case that has strained ties between Turkey and the United States.
