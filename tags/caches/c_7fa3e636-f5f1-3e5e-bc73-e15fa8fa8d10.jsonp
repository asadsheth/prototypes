The crash occurred about 11 p.m. Friday, when the driver of a silver BMW lost control of the car while speeding east on Lassen Street alongside a dark-colored sedan, said Officer Shane Bales of the Los Angeles Police Department. The BMW crossed into oncoming traffic lanes near Balboa Boulevard and hit a light pole before slamming into a tree. Flames engulfed the car, and the impact was so severe that it ejected the car's engine, Bales said. The car broke into several pieces.
