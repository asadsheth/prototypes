The Tesla's electric motors can produce massive amounts of torque right off the line, which means that any gas engine isn't going to come close to the 0-60 times. But Top Gear wanted to thoroughly test the limits of the Tesla's speed, so they put it up against a Mercedes E63 AMG 4-door sedan, the answer to every engineer's question of \"how far is too far.\" https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/topgear\/videos\/vb.282681245570\/10159643278165571\/ The result really isn't surprising at all: the Tesla takes the Mercedes by a couple car-lengths. It beat it off the line, and there wasn't really a hope of a comeback at any point. If the race had been twice as long, the Mercedes may well have caught up -- electric cars suck at extremely high speeds, where air resistance is more of a factor -- but over a standard drag-race distance, it's humbling to see just how fast the Tesla is. The video did showcase one other thing, though: Tesla's aren't nearly as reliable or intuitive as the gas-powered cars. We've been conditioned by years of driving to expect certain controls and processes, and by all accounts, driving a Tesla is a big change. That showed up here, as the driver of the Tesla had to turn the car off and on again just to get it to start.","published_at":1508371531,"content_id":"98d8b5fe-9409-3204-b8ea-eb4b0aa23692","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/tech\/top-gear-raced-tesla-100d-against-mercedes-sedan-000033878.html","content_published_at":1508371233,"content_relative_time":23,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10"},"created_at":1508397968,"comment_relative_time":15,"bot":false,"ripostes":{"text":"24 hr or 500k mile test with Telsa battery exchanger... no issues Telsa wins and doesn't release the co2 the IC would.
