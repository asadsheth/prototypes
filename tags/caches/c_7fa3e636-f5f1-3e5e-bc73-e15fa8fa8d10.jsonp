Air Canada Flight 781, an Airbus A320, was preparing to land at SFO on Runway 28-Right on Sunday night after a six-hour flight from Montreal. The crew acknowledged the tower's clearance to land when they were six miles away from the airport, said FAA spokesman Ian Gregor.

Jess Wilkes, 27, died on Saturday night after she fell into the river Rhone at Avignon as she was returning to her accommodation after a dinner with her boyfriend and other friends in a picturesque riverside restaurant. An autopsy on the London-based mother-of-one is due to be carried out on Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor\u2019s office in Avignon said. Ms Wilkes was in France to celebrate her boss's birthday Credit: Facebook Police are investigating whether the skipper of the\u00a0river boat was responsible for the death after it collided with a metal post. The skipper\u2019s leg was broken in the collision and he is currently in hospital, the prosecutor\u2019s spokeswoman said. \u201cIt appears that he saw the post (a navigation mark in the river) too late and was unable to avoid it,\u201d she\u00a0said, adding that the three other Britons and two French tourists on the boat would also be interviewed by police. Ms Wilkes\u2019 parents, who live in Tunbridge Wells, paid tribute to their \u201cloving daughter, caring sister and proud mother to Alissia, five.\u201d \u201cShe was a social butterfly who made everyone around her feel special and had an infectious energy and passion that she applied to everything in life,\u201d they said in a statement. Five others were injured in the Rhone incident, two seriously, including another Briton Credit: GETTY IMAGES Ms Wilkes, a PA at an architect\u2019s firm who was educated at the \u00a330,000 a year Kent College in Pembury, had flown over to France with friends to celebrate the 33rd birthday of her boss, who is believed to have family members living in the Avignon area. The group dined on Saturday night at the Guinguette du Vieux Moulin, a picturesque restaurant on the far bank of the Rhone with a terrace right on the water\u2019s edge. Then at around 10:45 pm local time they boarded the 22-foot shuttle boat to take them back to Avignon, which by road lies only a couple of miles from the restaurant. What happened next is the focus of the manslaughter inquiry. Police will try to determine if the skipper was going too fast, had drunk alcohol, and whether the boat was properly equipped for a night trip. Philip, Susanna, Alissia, Jessica and Bernard The victim\u2019s tearful mother Susanna said from her home in Tunbridge Wells: \u201cIt is such a dreadful accident. She was thrown over the front of the boat and straight into the bollard.\u201d \u201cAll I am thankful for is that she did not suffer. She had such a bad injury to her head,\u201d she said. Rescue workers also said that it appeared that Ms Wilkes had been knocked unconscious in the collision and then drowned when she fell into the water. Dozens of rescuers were sent to the scene and a sniffer dog searched the banks of the Rhone for Ms Wilkes while divers hunted in the waters of the river. \u201cAfter about three hours, divers found her body on the bottom of the river at a depth of about six metres, several dozen metres downstream from where the accident took place,\u201d a rescue official said. Jessica with her brothers Ms Wilkes\u2019 mother said she did not believe alcohol was a factor in the crash. \u201cThere is some talk that maybe it is suspicious but none of the party were drinkers and I think they were fine\u2026 It was just a very civilised meal, it wasn\u2019t some big party, and then they were coming back in the boat when it happened.\u201d She said the man skippering the boat was an experienced sailor who had navigated up and down that stretch of the Rhone countless times. The victim\u2019s father, Bernard, and her older brother Christopher are currently on their way to Avignon. Miss Wilkes\u2019 other\u00a0brother, Phillip, 25, said that his sister\u2019s daughter was being cared for by her former partner with whom she had an amicable relationship.","published_at":1508747001,"content_id":"25eeb1ea-537b-3c1b-bb4e-00bb5aba6f16","content_url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/british-mother-27-killed-speedboat-082056524.html","content_published_at":1508746856,"content_relative_time":37,"vibe_name":"Transportation","vibe_id":"7fa3e636-f5f1-3e5e-bc73-e15fa8fa8d10"},"created_at":0,"comment_relative_time":37,"bot":true}]);
